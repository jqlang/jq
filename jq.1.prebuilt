.SH "NAME"
\fBjq\fR \- Command\-line JSON processor
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBjq\fR [\fIoptions\fR\.\.\.] \fIfilter\fR [\fIfiles\fR\.\.\.]
.
.P
\fBjq\fR can transform JSON in various ways, by selecting, iterating, reducing and otherwise mangling JSON documents\. For instance, running the command \fBjq \'map(\.price) | add\'\fR will take an array of JSON objects as input and return the sum of their "price" fields\.
.
.P
\fBjq\fR can accept text input as well, but by default, \fBjq\fR reads a stream of JSON entities (including numbers and other literals) from \fBstdin\fR\. Whitespace is only needed to separate entities such as 1 and 2, and true and false\. One or more \fIfiles\fR may be specified, in which case \fBjq\fR will read input from those instead\.
.
.P
The \fIoptions\fR are described in the [INVOKING JQ] section; they mostly concern input and output formatting\. The \fIfilter\fR is written in the jq language and specifies how to transform the input file or document\.
.
.SH "FILTERS"
A jq program is a "filter": it takes an input, and produces an output\. There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a particular field of an object, or converting a number to a string, or various other standard tasks\.
.
.P
Filters can be combined in various ways \- you can pipe the output of one filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter into an array\.
.
.P
Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there\'s one that produces all the elements of its input array\. Piping that filter into a second runs the second filter for each element of the array\. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration in other languages are just done by gluing filters together in jq\.
.
.P
It\'s important to remember that every filter has an input and an output\. Even literals like "hello" or 42 are filters \- they take an input but always produce the same literal as output\. Operations that combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to both and combine the results\. So, you can implement an averaging filter as \fBadd / length\fR \- feeding the input array both to the \fBadd\fR filter and the \fBlength\fR filter and then performing the division\.
.
.P
But that\'s getting ahead of ourselves\. :) Let\'s start with something simpler:
.
.SH "INVOKING JQ"
jq filters run on a stream of JSON data\. The input to jq is parsed as a sequence of whitespace\-separated JSON values which are passed through the provided filter one at a time\. The output(s) of the filter are written to standard output, as a sequence of newline\-separated JSON data\.
.
.P
The simplest and most common filter (or jq program) is \fB\.\fR, which is the identity operator, copying the inputs of the jq processor to the output stream\. Because the default behavior of the jq processor is to read JSON texts from the input stream, and to pretty\-print outputs, the \fB\.\fR program\'s main use is to validate and pretty\-print the inputs\. The jq programming language is quite rich and allows for much more than just validation and pretty\-printing\.
.
.P
Note: it is important to mind the shell\'s quoting rules\. As a general rule it\'s best to always quote (with single\-quote characters on Unix shells) the jq program, as too many characters with special meaning to jq are also shell meta\-characters\. For example, \fBjq "foo"\fR will fail on most Unix shells because that will be the same as \fBjq foo\fR, which will generally fail because \fBfoo is not defined\fR\. When using the Windows command shell (cmd\.exe) it\'s best to use double quotes around your jq program when given on the command\-line (instead of the \fB\-f program\-file\fR option), but then double\-quotes in the jq program need backslash escaping\. When using the Powershell (\fBpowershell\.exe\fR) or the Powershell Core (\fBpwsh\fR/\fBpwsh\.exe\fR), use single\-quote characters around the jq program and backslash\-escaped double\-quotes (\fB\e"\fR) inside the jq program\.

.P
Note: jq allows user\-defined functions, but every jq program must have a top\-level expression\.
.
.P
You can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output using some command\-line options:
.
.TP
\fB\-\-null\-input\fR / \fB\-n\fR:
.
.IP
Don\'t read any input at all\. Instead, the filter is run once using \fBnull\fR as the input\. This is useful when using jq as a simple calculator or to construct JSON data from scratch\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-raw\-input\fR / \fB\-R\fR:
.
.IP
Don\'t parse the input as JSON\. Instead, each line of text is passed to the filter as a string\. If combined with \fB\-\-slurp\fR, then the entire input is passed to the filter as a single long string\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-slurp\fR / \fB\-s\fR:
.
.IP
Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the input, read the entire input stream into a large array and run the filter just once\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-compact\-output\fR / \fB\-c\fR:
.
.IP
By default, jq pretty\-prints JSON output\. Using this option will result in more compact output by instead putting each JSON object on a single line\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-raw\-output\fR / \fB\-r\fR:
.
.IP
With this option, if the filter\'s result is a string then it will be written directly to standard output rather than being formatted as a JSON string with quotes\. This can be useful for making jq filters talk to non\-JSON\-based systems\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-raw\-output0\fR:
.
.IP
Like \fB\-r\fR but jq will print NUL instead of newline after each output\. This can be useful when the values being output can contain newlines\. When the output value contains NUL, jq exits with non\-zero code\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-join\-output\fR / \fB\-j\fR:
.
.IP
Like \fB\-r\fR but jq won\'t print a newline after each output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-ascii\-output\fR / \fB\-a\fR:
.
.IP
jq usually outputs non\-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF\-8, even if the input specified them as escape sequences (like "\eu03bc")\. Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII output with every non\-ASCII character replaced with the equivalent escape sequence\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-sort\-keys\fR / \fB\-S\fR:
.
.IP
Output the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-color\-output\fR / \fB\-C\fR and \fB\-\-monochrome\-output\fR / \fB\-M\fR:
.
.IP
By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a terminal\. You can force it to produce color even if writing to a pipe or a file using \fB\-C\fR, and disable color with \fB\-M\fR\. When the \fBNO_COLOR\fR environment variable is not empty, jq disables colored output by default, but you can enable it by \fB\-C\fR\.
.
.IP
Colors can be configured with the \fBJQ_COLORS\fR environment variable (see below)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-tab\fR:
.
.IP
Use a tab for each indentation level instead of two spaces\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-indent n\fR:
.
.IP
Use the given number of spaces (no more than 7) for indentation\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-unbuffered\fR:
.
.IP
Flush the output after each JSON object is printed (useful if you\'re piping a slow data source into jq and piping jq\'s output elsewhere)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-stream\fR:
.
.IP
Parse the input in streaming fashion, outputting arrays of path and leaf values (scalars and empty arrays or empty objects)\. For example, \fB"a"\fR becomes \fB[[],"a"]\fR, and \fB[[],"a",["b"]]\fR becomes \fB[[0],[]]\fR, \fB[[1],"a"]\fR, and \fB[[2,0],"b"]\fR\.
.
.IP
This is useful for processing very large inputs\. Use this in conjunction with filtering and the \fBreduce\fR and \fBforeach\fR syntax to reduce large inputs incrementally\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-stream\-errors\fR:
.
.IP
Like \fB\-\-stream\fR, but invalid JSON inputs yield array values where the first element is the error and the second is a path\. For example, \fB["a",n]\fR produces \fB["Invalid literal at line 1, column 7",[1]]\fR\.
.
.IP
Implies \fB\-\-stream\fR\. Invalid JSON inputs produce no error values when \fB\-\-stream\fR without \fB\-\-stream\-errors\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-seq\fR:
.
.IP
Use the \fBapplication/json\-seq\fR MIME type scheme for separating JSON texts in jq\'s input and output\. This means that an ASCII RS (record separator) character is printed before each value on output and an ASCII LF (line feed) is printed after every output\. Input JSON texts that fail to parse are ignored (but warned about), discarding all subsequent input until the next RS\. This mode also parses the output of jq without the \fB\-\-seq\fR option\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f filename\fR / \fB\-\-from\-file filename\fR:
.
.IP
Read filter from the file rather than from a command line, like awk\'s \-f option\. You can also use \'#\' to make comments\.
.
.TP
\fB\-L directory\fR:
.
.IP
Prepend \fBdirectory\fR to the search list for modules\. If this option is used then no builtin search list is used\. See the section on modules below\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-arg name value\fR:
.
.IP
This option passes a value to the jq program as a predefined variable\. If you run jq with \fB\-\-arg foo bar\fR, then \fB$foo\fR is available in the program and has the value \fB"bar"\fR\. Note that \fBvalue\fR will be treated as a string, so \fB\-\-arg foo 123\fR will bind \fB$foo\fR to \fB"123"\fR\.
.
.IP
Named arguments are also available to the jq program as \fB$ARGS\.named\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-argjson name JSON\-text\fR:
.
.IP
This option passes a JSON\-encoded value to the jq program as a predefined variable\. If you run jq with \fB\-\-argjson foo 123\fR, then \fB$foo\fR is available in the program and has the value \fB123\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-slurpfile variable\-name filename\fR:
.
.IP
This option reads all the JSON texts in the named file and binds an array of the parsed JSON values to the given global variable\. If you run jq with \fB\-\-slurpfile foo bar\fR, then \fB$foo\fR is available in the program and has an array whose elements correspond to the texts in the file named \fBbar\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-rawfile variable\-name filename\fR:
.
.IP
This option reads in the named file and binds its contents to the given global variable\. If you run jq with \fB\-\-rawfile foo bar\fR, then \fB$foo\fR is available in the program and has a string whose contents are to the texts in the file named \fBbar\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-args\fR:
.
.IP
Remaining arguments are positional string arguments\. These are available to the jq program as \fB$ARGS\.positional[]\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-jsonargs\fR:
.
.IP
Remaining arguments are positional JSON text arguments\. These are available to the jq program as \fB$ARGS\.positional[]\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-exit\-status\fR / \fB\-e\fR:
.
.IP
Sets the exit status of jq to 0 if the last output value was neither \fBfalse\fR nor \fBnull\fR, 1 if the last output value was either \fBfalse\fR or \fBnull\fR, or 4 if no valid result was ever produced\. Normally jq exits with 2 if there was any usage problem or system error, 3 if there was a jq program compile error, or 0 if the jq program ran\.
.
.IP
Another way to set the exit status is with the \fBhalt_error\fR builtin function\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-binary\fR / \fB\-b\fR:
.
.IP
Windows users using WSL, MSYS2, or Cygwin, should use this option when using a native jq\.exe, otherwise jq will turn newlines (LFs) into carriage\-return\-then\-newline (CRLF)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR / \fB\-V\fR:
.
.IP
Output the jq version and exit with zero\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-build\-configuration\fR:
.
.IP
Output the build configuration of jq and exit with zero\. This output has no supported format or structure and may change without notice in future releases\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR / \fB\-h\fR:
.
.IP
Output the jq help and exit with zero\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-\fR:
.
.IP
Terminates argument processing\. Remaining arguments are not interpreted as options\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-run\-tests [filename]\fR:
.
.IP
Runs the tests in the given file or standard input\. This must be the last option given and does not honor all preceding options\. The input consists of comment lines, empty lines, and program lines followed by one input line, as many lines of output as are expected (one per output), and a terminating empty line\. Compilation failure tests start with a line containing only \fB%%FAIL\fR, then a line containing the program to compile, then a line containing an error message to compare to the actual\.
.
.IP
Be warned that this option can change backwards\-incompatibly\.
.
.SH "BASIC FILTERS"
.
.SS "Identity: \."
The absolute simplest filter is \fB\.\fR \. This filter takes its input and produces the same value as output\. That is, this is the identity operator\.
.
.P
Since jq by default pretty\-prints all output, a trivial program consisting of nothing but \fB\.\fR can be used to format JSON output from, say, \fBcurl\fR\.
.
.P
Although the identity filter never modifies the value of its input, jq processing can sometimes make it appear as though it does\. For example, using the current implementation of jq, we would see that the expression:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

1E1234567890 | \.
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
produces \fB1\.7976931348623157e+308\fR on at least one platform\. This is because, in the process of parsing the number, this particular version of jq has converted it to an IEEE754 double\-precision representation, losing precision\.
.
.P
The way in which jq handles numbers has changed over time and further changes are likely within the parameters set by the relevant JSON standards\. The following remarks are therefore offered with the understanding that they are intended to be descriptive of the current version of jq and should not be interpreted as being prescriptive:
.
.P
(1) Any arithmetic operation on a number that has not already been converted to an IEEE754 double precision representation will trigger a conversion to the IEEE754 representation\.
.
.P
(2) jq will attempt to maintain the original decimal precision of number literals, but in expressions such \fB1E1234567890\fR, precision will be lost if the exponent is too large\.
.
.P
(3) In jq programs, a leading minus sign will trigger the conversion of the number to an IEEE754 representation\.
.
.P
(4) Comparisons are carried out using the untruncated big decimal representation of numbers if available, as illustrated in one of the following examples\.

.SS "Object Identifier\-Index: \.foo, \.foo\.bar"
The simplest \fIuseful\fR filter has the form \fB\.foo\fR\. When given a JSON object (aka dictionary or hash) as input, \fB\.foo\fR produces the value at the key "foo" if the key is present, or null otherwise\.
.
.P
A filter of the form \fB\.foo\.bar\fR is equivalent to \fB\.foo | \.bar\fR\.
.
.P
The \fB\.foo\fR syntax only works for simple, identifier\-like keys, that is, keys that are all made of alphanumeric characters and underscore, and which do not start with a digit\.
.
.P
If the key contains special characters or starts with a digit, you need to surround it with double quotes like this: \fB\."foo$"\fR, or else \fB\.["foo$"]\fR\.

If the one on the left produces multiple results, the one on the right will be run for each of those results\. So, the expression \fB\.[] | \.foo\fR retrieves the "foo" field of each element of the input array\. This is a cartesian product, which can be surprising\.

.SH "TYPES AND VALUES"
jq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON \- numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects (which in JSON\-speak are hashes with only string keys), and "null"\.
.
.P
Booleans, null, strings and numbers are written the same way as in JSON\. Just like everything else in jq, these simple values take an input and produce an output \- \fB42\fR is a valid jq expression that takes an input, ignores it, and returns 42 instead\.
.
.P
Numbers in jq are internally represented by their IEEE754 double precision approximation\. Any arithmetic operation with numbers, whether they are literals or results of previous filters, will produce a double precision floating point result\.
.
.P
However, when parsing a literal jq will store the original literal string\. If no mutation is applied to this value then it will make to the output in its original form, even if conversion to double would result in a loss\.
.
.SS "Array construction: []"
As in JSON, \fB[]\fR is used to construct arrays, as in \fB[1,2,3]\fR\. The elements of the arrays can be any jq expression, including a pipeline\. All of the results produced by all of the expressions are collected into one big array\. You can use it to construct an array out of a known quantity of values (as in \fB[\.foo, \.bar, \.baz]\fR) or to "collect" all the results of a filter into an array (as in \fB[\.items[]\.name]\fR)
.
.P
Once you understand the "," operator, you can look at jq\'s array syntax in a different light: the expression \fB[1,2,3]\fR is not using a built\-in syntax for comma\-separated arrays, but is instead applying the \fB[]\fR operator (collect results) to the expression 1,2,3 (which produces three different results)\.
.
.P
If you have a filter \fBX\fR that produces four results, then the expression \fB[X]\fR will produce a single result, an array of four elements\.

If the keys are "identifier\-like", then the quotes can be left off, as in \fB{a:42, b:17}\fR\. Variable references as key expressions use the value of the variable as the key\. Key expressions other than constant literals, identifiers, or variable references, need to be parenthesized, e\.g\., \fB{("a"+"b"):59}\fR\.

The value can be any expression (although you may need to wrap it in parentheses if, for example, it contains colons), which gets applied to the {} expression\'s input (remember, all filters have an input and an output)\.

.SH "BUILTIN OPERATORS AND FUNCTIONS"
Some jq operators (for instance, \fB+\fR) do different things depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers, etc\.)\. However, jq never does implicit type conversions\. If you try to add a string to an object you\'ll get an error message and no result\.
.
.P
Please note that all numbers are converted to IEEE754 double precision floating point representation\. Arithmetic and logical operators are working with these converted doubles\. Results of all such operations are also limited to the double precision\.
.
.P
The only exception to this behaviour of number is a snapshot of original number literal\. When a number which originally was provided as a literal is never mutated until the end of the program then it is printed to the output in its original literal form\. This also includes cases when the original literal would be truncated when converted to the IEEE754 double precision floating point number\.
.
.SS "Addition: +"
The operator \fB+\fR takes two filters, applies them both to the same input, and adds the results together\. What "adding" means depends on the types involved:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBNumbers\fR are added by normal arithmetic\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBArrays\fR are added by being concatenated into a larger array\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBStrings\fR are added by being joined into a larger string\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBObjects\fR are added by merging, that is, inserting all the key\-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object\. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object on the right of the \fB+\fR wins\. (For recursive merge use the \fB*\fR operator\.)
.

\fBnull\fR can be added to any value, and returns the other value unchanged\.

For any filter \fBf\fR, \fBmap(f)\fR and \fBmap_values(f)\fR apply \fBf\fR to each of the values in the input array or object, that is, to the values of \fB\.[]\fR\.
.
.P
In the absence of errors, \fBmap(f)\fR always outputs an array whereas \fBmap_values(f)\fR outputs an array if given an array, or an object if given an object\.
.
.P
When the input to \fBmap_values(f)\fR is an object, the output object has the same keys as the input object except for those keys whose values when piped to \fBf\fR produce no values at all\.
.
.P
The key difference between \fBmap(f)\fR and \fBmap_values(f)\fR is that the former simply forms an array from all the values of \fB($x|f)\fR for each value, $x, in the input array or object, but \fBmap_values(f)\fR only uses \fBfirst($x|f)\fR\.
.
.P
Specifically, for object inputs, \fBmap_value(f)\fR constructs the output object by examining in turn the value of \fBfirst(\.[$k]|f)\fR for each key, $k, of the input\. If this expression produces no values, then the corresponding key will be dropped; otherwise, the output object will have that value at the key, $k\.
.

.SS "Dates"
jq provides some basic date handling functionality, with some high\-level and low\-level builtins\. In all cases these builtins deal exclusively with time in UTC\.
.
.P
The \fBfromdateiso8601\fR builtin parses datetimes in the ISO 8601 format to a number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z)\. The \fBtodateiso8601\fR builtin does the inverse\.
.
.P
The \fBfromdate\fR builtin parses datetime strings\. Currently \fBfromdate\fR only supports ISO 8601 datetime strings, but in the future it will attempt to parse datetime strings in more formats\.
.
.P
The \fBtodate\fR builtin is an alias for \fBtodateiso8601\fR\.
.
.P
The \fBnow\fR builtin outputs the current time, in seconds since the Unix epoch\.
.
.P
Low\-level jq interfaces to the C\-library time functions are also provided: \fBstrptime\fR, \fBstrftime\fR, \fBstrflocaltime\fR, \fBmktime\fR, \fBgmtime\fR, and \fBlocaltime\fR\. Refer to your host operating system\'s documentation for the format strings used by \fBstrptime\fR and \fBstrftime\fR\. Note: these are not necessarily stable interfaces in jq, particularly as to their localization functionality\.
.
.P
The \fBgmtime\fR builtin consumes a number of seconds since the Unix epoch and outputs a "broken down time" representation of Greenwich Mean Time as an array of numbers representing (in this order): the year, the month (zero\-based), the day of the month (one\-based), the hour of the day, the minute of the hour, the second of the minute, the day of the week, and the day of the year \-\- all one\-based unless otherwise stated\. The day of the week number may be wrong on some systems for dates before March 1st 1900, or after December 31 2099\.
.
.P
The \fBlocaltime\fR builtin works like the \fBgmtime\fR builtin, but using the local timezone setting\.
.
.P
The \fBmktime\fR builtin consumes "broken down time" representations of time output by \fBgmtime\fR and \fBstrptime\fR\.
.
.P
The \fBstrptime(fmt)\fR builtin parses input strings matching the \fBfmt\fR argument\. The output is in the "broken down time" representation consumed by \fBgmtime\fR and output by \fBmktime\fR\.
.
.P
The \fBstrftime(fmt)\fR builtin formats a time (GMT) with the given format\. The \fBstrflocaltime\fR does the same, but using the local timezone setting\.
.
.P
The format strings for \fBstrptime\fR and \fBstrftime\fR are described in typical C library documentation\. The format string for ISO 8601 datetime is \fB"%Y\-%m\-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"\fR\.
.
.P
jq may not support some or all of this date functionality on some systems\. In particular, the \fB%u\fR and \fB%j\fR specifiers for \fBstrptime(fmt)\fR are not supported on macOS\.

.
.TP
JOIN($idx; stream; idx_expr; join_expr):
.
.IP
This builtin joins the values from the given stream to the given index\. The index\'s keys are computed by applying the given index expression to each value from the given stream\. An array of the value in the stream and the corresponding value from the index is fed to the given join expression to produce each result\.
.
.TP
JOIN($idx; stream; idx_expr):
.
.IP
Same as \fBJOIN($idx; stream; idx_expr; \.)\fR\.
.
.TP
JOIN($idx; idx_expr):
.
.IP
This builtin joins the input \fB\.\fR to the given index, applying the given index expression to \fB\.\fR to compute the index key\. The join operation is as described above\.
.
.TP
IN(s):
.
.IP
This builtin outputs \fBtrue\fR if \fB\.\fR appears in the given stream, otherwise it outputs \fBfalse\fR\.
.
.TP
IN(source; s):
.
.IP
This builtin outputs \fBtrue\fR if any value in the source stream appears in the second stream, otherwise it outputs \fBfalse\fR\.
.
.SS "builtins"
Returns a list of all builtin functions in the format \fBname/arity\fR\. Since functions with the same name but different arities are considered separate functions, \fBall/0\fR, \fBall/1\fR, and \fBall/2\fR would all be present in the list\.
.
.SH "CONDITIONALS AND COMPARISONS"
.
.SS "==, !="
The expression \'a == b\' will produce \'true\' if the results of evaluating a and b are equal (that is, if they represent equivalent JSON values) and \'false\' otherwise\. In particular, strings are never considered equal to numbers\. In checking for the equality of JSON objects, the ordering of keys is irrelevant\. If you\'re coming from JavaScript, please note that jq\'s \fB==\fR is like JavaScript\'s \fB===\fR, the "strict equality" operator\.

!= is "not equal", and \'a != b\' returns the opposite value of \'a == b\'

\fBif A then B end\fR is the same as \fBif A then B else \.  end\fR\. That is, the \fBelse\fR branch is optional, and if absent is the same as \fB\.\fR\. This also applies to \fBelif\fR with absent ending \fBelse\fR branch\.
.
.P
Checking for false or null is a simpler notion of "truthiness" than is found in JavaScript or Python, but it means that you\'ll sometimes have to be more explicit about the condition you want\. You can\'t test whether, e\.g\. a string is empty using \fBif \.name then A else B end\fR; you\'ll need something like \fBif \.name == "" then A else B end\fR instead\.

If the condition \fBA\fR produces multiple results, then \fBB\fR is evaluated once for each result that is not false or null, and \fBC\fR is evaluated once for each false or null\.

jq supports the normal Boolean operators \fBand\fR, \fBor\fR, \fBnot\fR\. They have the same standard of truth as if expressions \- \fBfalse\fR and \fBnull\fR are considered "false values", and anything else is a "true value"\.
.
.P
If an operand of one of these operators produces multiple results, the operator itself will produce a result for each input\.
.
.P
\fBnot\fR is in fact a builtin function rather than an operator, so it is called as a filter to which things can be piped rather than with special syntax, as in \fB\.foo and \.bar | not\fR\.
.
.P
These three only produce the values \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR, and so are only useful for genuine Boolean operations, rather than the common Perl/Python/Ruby idiom of "value_that_may_be_null or default"\. If you want to use this form of "or", picking between two values rather than evaluating a condition, see the \fB//\fR operator below\.

The \fB//\fR operator produces all the values of its left\-hand side that are neither \fBfalse\fR nor \fBnull\fR, or, if the left\-hand side produces no values other than \fBfalse\fR or \fBnull\fR, then \fB//\fR produces all the values of its right\-hand side\.

A filter of the form \fBa // b\fR produces all the results of \fBa\fR that are not \fBfalse\fR or \fBnull\fR\. If \fBa\fR produces no results, or no results other than \fBfalse\fR or \fBnull\fR, then \fBa // b\fR produces the results of \fBb\fR\.
.
.P
This is useful for providing defaults: \fB\.foo // 1\fR will evaluate to \fB1\fR if there\'s no \fB\.foo\fR element in the input\. It\'s similar to how \fBor\fR is sometimes used in Python (jq\'s \fBor\fR operator is reserved for strictly Boolean operations)\.
.
.P
Note: \fBsome_generator // defaults_here\fR is not the same as \fBsome_generator | \. // defaults_here\fR\. The latter will produce default values for all non\-\fBfalse\fR, non\-\fBnull\fR values of the left\-hand side, while the former will not\. Precedence rules can make this confusing\. For example, in \fBfalse, 1 // 2\fR the left\-hand side of \fB//\fR is \fB1\fR, not \fBfalse, 1\fR \-\- \fBfalse, 1 // 2\fR parses the same way as \fBfalse, (1 // 2)\fR\. In \fB(false, null, 1) | \. // 42\fR the left\-hand side of \fB//\fR is \fB\.\fR, which always produces just one value, while in \fB(false, null, 1) // 42\fR the left\-hand side is a generator of three values, and since it produces a value other \fBfalse\fR and \fBnull\fR, the default \fB42\fR is not produced\.

It is also possible to define functions in jq, although this is is a feature whose biggest use is defining jq\'s standard library (many jq functions such as \fBmap\fR and \fBselect\fR are in fact written in jq)\.
.
.P
jq has reduction operators, which are very powerful but a bit tricky\. Again, these are mostly used internally, to define some useful bits of jq\'s standard library\.
.
.P
It may not be obvious at first, but jq is all about generators (yes, as often found in other languages)\. Some utilities are provided to help deal with generators\.
.
.P
Some minimal I/O support (besides reading JSON from standard input, and writing JSON to standard output) is available\.
.
.P
Finally, there is a module/library system\.
.
.SS "Variable / Symbolic Binding Operator: \.\.\. as $identifier | \.\.\."
In jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual plumbing is not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program to the next\. Many expressions, for instance \fBa + b\fR, pass their input to two distinct subexpressions (here \fBa\fR and \fBb\fR are both passed the same input), so variables aren\'t usually necessary in order to use a value twice\.
.
.P
For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers requires a few variables in most languages \- at least one to hold the array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter\. In jq, it\'s simply \fBadd / length\fR \- the \fBadd\fR expression is given the array and produces its sum, and the \fBlength\fR expression is given the array and produces its length\.
.
.P
So, there\'s generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jq than defining variables\. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jq lets you define variables using \fBexpression as $variable\fR\. All variable names start with \fB$\fR\. Here\'s a slightly uglier version of the array\-averaging example:
.

.nf

length as $array_length | add / $array_length

.P
We\'ll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where using variables actually makes our lives easier\.
.
.P
Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with "author" and "title" fields, and another object which is used to map author usernames to real names\. Our input looks like:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

{"posts": [{"title": "First post", "author": "anon"},
           {"title": "A well\-written article", "author": "person1"}],

               "person1": "Person McPherson"}}

{"title": "First post", "author": "Anonymous Coward"}
{"title": "A well\-written article", "author": "Person McPherson"}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

We use a variable, $names, to store the realnames object, so that we can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

\&.realnames as $names | \.posts[] | {title, author: $names[\.author]}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The expression \fBexp as $x | \.\.\.\fR means: for each value of expression \fBexp\fR, run the rest of the pipeline with the entire original input, and with \fB$x\fR set to that value\. Thus \fBas\fR functions as something of a foreach loop\.
.
.P
Just as \fB{foo}\fR is a handy way of writing \fB{foo: \.foo}\fR, so \fB{$foo}\fR is a handy way of writing \fB{foo: $foo}\fR\.
.
.P
Multiple variables may be declared using a single \fBas\fR expression by providing a pattern that matches the structure of the input (this is known as "destructuring"):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

\&. as {realnames: $names, posts: [$first, $second]} | \.\.\.
.

.
.IP "" 0
.

The variable declarations in array patterns (e\.g\., \fB\. as [$first, $second]\fR) bind to the elements of the array in from the element at index zero on up, in order\. When there is no value at the index for an array pattern element, \fBnull\fR is bound to that variable\.
.
.P
Variables are scoped over the rest of the expression that defines them, so
.

For programming language theorists, it\'s more accurate to say that jq variables are lexically\-scoped bindings\. In particular there\'s no way to change the value of a binding; one can only setup a new binding with the same name, but which will not be visible where the old one was\.

The destructuring alternative operator provides a concise mechanism for destructuring an input that can take one of several forms\.
.
.P
Suppose we have an API that returns a list of resources and events associated with them, and we want to get the user_id and timestamp of the first event for each resource\. The API (having been clumsily converted from XML) will only wrap the events in an array if the resource has multiple events:
.

We can use the destructuring alternative operator to handle this structural change simply:

Each alternative need not define all of the same variables, but all named variables will be available to the subsequent expression\. Variables not matched in the alternative that succeeded will be \fBnull\fR:

Additionally, if the subsequent expression returns an error, the alternative operator will attempt to try the next binding\. Errors that occur during the final alternative are passed through\.

def increment: \. + 1;
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
From then on, \fBincrement\fR is usable as a filter just like a builtin function (in fact, this is how many of the builtins are defined)\. A function may take arguments:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

def map(f): [\.[] | f];
.

.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Arguments are passed as \fIfilters\fR (functions with no arguments), \fInot\fR as values\. The same argument may be referenced multiple times with different inputs (here \fBf\fR is run for each element of the input array)\. Arguments to a function work more like callbacks than like value arguments\. This is important to understand\. Consider:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

def foo(f): f|f;
5|foo(\.*2)
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The result will be 20 because \fBf\fR is \fB\.*2\fR, and during the first invocation of \fBf\fR \fB\.\fR will be 5, and the second time it will be 10 (5 * 2), so the result will be 20\. Function arguments are filters, and filters expect an input when invoked\.
.
.P
If you want the value\-argument behaviour for defining simple functions, you can just use a variable:
.
.IP "" 4
.

Or use the short\-hand:

def addvalue($f): \.\.\.;

With either definition, \fBaddvalue(\.foo)\fR will add the current input\'s \fB\.foo\fR field to each element of the array\. Do note that calling \fBaddvalue(\.[])\fR will cause the \fBmap(\. + $f)\fR part to be evaluated once per value in the value of \fB\.\fR at the call site\.

Multiple definitions using the same function name are allowed\. Each re\-definition replaces the previous one for the same number of function arguments, but only for references from functions (or main program) subsequent to the re\-definition\. See also the section below on scoping\.

There are two types of symbols in jq: value bindings (a\.k\.a\., "variables"), and functions\. Both are scoped lexically, with expressions being able to refer only to symbols that have been defined "to the left" of them\. The only exception to this rule is that functions can refer to themselves so as to be able to create recursive functions\.
.
.P
For example, in the following expression there is a binding which is visible "to the right" of it, \fB\.\.\. | \.*3 as $times_three | [\. + $times_three] | \.\.\.\fR, but not "to the left"\. Consider this expression now, \fB\.\.\. | (\.*3 as $times_three | [\. + $times_three]) | \.\.\.\fR: here the binding \fB$times_three\fR is \fInot\fR visible past the closing parenthesis\.

Like the \fBreduce\fR syntax, \fB\. + $item\fR is run for each result that \fB\.[]\fR produces, but \fB[$item, \. * 2]\fR is run for each intermediate values\. In this example, since the intermediate values are \fB1\fR, \fB3\fR, and \fB6\fR, the \fBforeach\fR expression produces \fB[1,2]\fR, \fB[2,6]\fR, and \fB[3,12]\fR\. So the effect is similar to running something like this:

Tail calls are optimized whenever the expression to the left of the recursive call outputs its last value\. In practice this means that the expression to the left of the recursive call should not produce more than one output for each input\.

.SS "Generators and iterators"
Some jq operators and functions are actually generators in that they can produce zero, one, or more values for each input, just as one might expect in other programming languages that have generators\. For example, \fB\.[]\fR generates all the values in its input (which must be an array or an object), \fBrange(0; 10)\fR generates the integers between 0 and 10, and so on\.
.
.P
Even the comma operator is a generator, generating first the values generated by the expression to the left of the comma, then the values generated by the expression on the right of the comma\.
.
.P
The \fBempty\fR builtin is the generator that produces zero outputs\. The \fBempty\fR builtin backtracks to the preceding generator expression\.
.
.P
All jq functions can be generators just by using builtin generators\. It is also possible to construct new generators using only recursion and the comma operator\. If recursive calls are "in tail position" then the generator will be efficient\. In the example below the recursive call by \fB_range\fR to itself is in tail position\. The example shows off three advanced topics: tail recursion, generator construction, and sub\-functions\.

At this time jq has minimal support for I/O, mostly in the form of control over when inputs are read\. Two builtins functions are provided for this, \fBinput\fR and \fBinputs\fR, that read from the same sources (e\.g\., \fBstdin\fR, files named on the command\-line) as jq itself\. These two builtins, and jq\'s own reading actions, can be interleaved with each other\. They are commonly used in combination with the null input option \fB\-n\fR to prevent one input from being read implicitly\.
.
.P
Two builtins provide minimal output capabilities, \fBdebug\fR, and \fBstderr\fR\. (Recall that a jq program\'s output values are always output as JSON texts on \fBstdout\fR\.) The \fBdebug\fR builtin can have application\-specific behavior, such as for executables that use the libjq C API but aren\'t the jq executable itself\. The \fBstderr\fR builtin outputs its input in raw mode to stder with no additional decoration, not even a newline\.

If you have a single JSON text that is 1GB in size, streaming it will allow you to process it much more quickly\.
.
.P
However, streaming isn\'t easy to deal with as the jq program will have \fB[<path>, <leaf\-value>]\fR (and a few other forms) as inputs\.
.
.P
Several builtins are provided to make handling streams easier\.
.
.P
The examples below use the streamed form of \fB[0,[1]]\fR, which is \fB[[0],0],[[1,0],1],[[1,0]],[[1]]\fR\.
.
.P
Streaming forms include \fB[<path>, <leaf\-value>]\fR (to indicate any scalar value, empty array, or empty object), and \fB[<path>]\fR (to indicate the end of an array or object)\. Future versions of jq run with \fB\-\-stream\fR and \fB\-\-seq\fR may output additional forms such as \fB["error message"]\fR when an input text fails to parse\.
.
.SS "truncate_stream(stream_expression)"

.SH "ASSIGNMENT"
Assignment works a little differently in jq than in most programming languages\. jq doesn\'t distinguish between references to and copies of something \- two objects or arrays are either equal or not equal, without any further notion of being "the same object" or "not the same object"\.
.
.P
If an object has two fields which are arrays, \fB\.foo\fR and \fB\.bar\fR, and you append something to \fB\.foo\fR, then \fB\.bar\fR will not get bigger, even if you\'ve previously set \fB\.bar = \.foo\fR\. If you\'re used to programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, etc\. then you can think of it as though jq does a full deep copy of every object before it does the assignment (for performance it doesn\'t actually do that, but that\'s the general idea)\.
.
.P
This means that it\'s impossible to build circular values in jq (such as an array whose first element is itself)\. This is quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jq program can produce can be represented in JSON\.
.
.P
All the assignment operators in jq have path expressions on the left\-hand side (LHS)\. The right\-hand side (RHS) provides values to set to the paths named by the LHS path expressions\.
.
.P
Values in jq are always immutable\. Internally, assignment works by using a reduction to compute new, replacement values for \fB\.\fR that have had all the desired assignments applied to \fB\.\fR, then outputting the modified value\. This might be made clear by this example: \fB{a:{b:{c:1}}} | (\.a\.b|=3), \.\fR\. This will output \fB{"a":{"b":3}}\fR and \fB{"a":{"b":{"c":1}}}\fR because the last sub\-expression, \fB\.\fR, sees the original value, not the modified value\.
.
.P
Most users will want to use modification assignment operators, such as \fB|=\fR or \fB+=\fR, rather than \fB=\fR\.
.
.P
Note that the LHS of assignment operators refers to a value in \fB\.\fR\. Thus \fB$var\.foo = 1\fR won\'t work as expected (\fB$var\.foo\fR is not a valid or useful path expression in \fB\.\fR); use \fB$var | \.foo = 1\fR instead\.
.
.P
Note too that \fB\.a,\.b=0\fR does not set \fB\.a\fR and \fB\.b\fR, but \fB(\.a,\.b)=0\fR sets both\.
.
.SS "Update\-assignment: |="
This is the "update" operator \fB|=\fR\. It takes a filter on the right\-hand side and works out the new value for the property of \fB\.\fR being assigned to by running the old value through this expression\. For instance, \fB(\.foo, \.bar) |= \.+1\fR will build an object with the \fBfoo\fR field set to the input\'s \fBfoo\fR plus 1, and the \fBbar\fR field set to the input\'s \fBbar\fR plus 1\.
.
.P
The left\-hand side can be any general path expression; see \fBpath()\fR\.
.
.P
Note that the left\-hand side of \fB|=\fR refers to a value in \fB\.\fR\. Thus \fB$var\.foo |= \. + 1\fR won\'t work as expected (\fB$var\.foo\fR is not a valid or useful path expression in \fB\.\fR); use \fB$var | \.foo |= \. + 1\fR instead\.
.
.P
If the right\-hand side outputs no values (i\.e\., \fBempty\fR), then the left\-hand side path will be deleted, as with \fBdel(path)\fR\.
.
.P
If the right\-hand side outputs multiple values, only the first one will be used (COMPATIBILITY NOTE: in jq 1\.5 and earlier releases, it used to be that only the last one was used)\.

.SS "Arithmetic update\-assignment: +=, \-=, *=, /=, %=, //="
jq has a few operators of the form \fBa op= b\fR, which are all equivalent to \fBa |= \. op b\fR\. So, \fB+= 1\fR can be used to increment values, being the same as \fB|= \. + 1\fR\.

.SS "Plain assignment: ="
This is the plain assignment operator\. Unlike the others, the input to the right\-hand side (RHS) is the same as the input to the left\-hand side (LHS) rather than the value at the LHS path, and all values output by the RHS will be used (as shown below)\.
.
.P
If the RHS of \fB=\fR produces multiple values, then for each such value jq will set the paths on the left\-hand side to the value and then it will output the modified \fB\.\fR\. For example, \fB(\.a,\.b) = range(2)\fR outputs \fB{"a":0,"b":0}\fR, then \fB{"a":1,"b":1}\fR\. The "update" assignment forms (see above) do not do this\.
.

This example should show the difference between \fB=\fR and \fB|=\fR:

.SS "Complex assignments"
Lots more things are allowed on the left\-hand side of a jq assignment than in most languages\. We\'ve already seen simple field accesses on the left hand side, and it\'s no surprise that array accesses work just as well:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

\&.posts[0]\.title = "JQ Manual"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
What may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may produce multiple results, referring to different points in the input document:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

\&.posts[]\.comments |= \. + ["this is great"]
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
That example appends the string "this is great" to the "comments" array of each post in the input (where the input is an object with a field "posts" which is an array of posts)\.
.
.P
When jq encounters an assignment like \'a = b\', it records the "path" taken to select a part of the input document while executing a\. This path is then used to find which part of the input to change while executing the assignment\. Any filter may be used on the left\-hand side of an equals \- whichever paths it selects from the input will be where the assignment is performed\.
.
.P
This is a very powerful operation\. Suppose we wanted to add a comment to blog posts, using the same "blog" input above\. This time, we only want to comment on the posts written by "stedolan"\. We can find those posts using the "select" function described earlier:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

\&.posts[] | select(\.author == "stedolan")
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that "stedolan" wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same way that we did before:

(\.posts[] | select(\.author == "stedolan") | \.comments) |=

.SH "MODULES"
jq has a library/module system\. Modules are files whose names end in \fB\.jq\fR\.
.
.P
Modules imported by a program are searched for in a default search path (see below)\. The \fBimport\fR and \fBinclude\fR directives allow the importer to alter this path\.
.
.P
Paths in the a search path are subject to various substitutions\.
.
.P
For paths starting with \fB~/\fR, the user\'s home directory is substituted for \fB~\fR\.
.
.P
For paths starting with \fB$ORIGIN/\fR, the directory where the jq executable is located is substituted for \fB$ORIGIN\fR\.
.
.P
For paths starting with \fB\./\fR or paths that are \fB\.\fR, the path of the including file is substituted for \fB\.\fR\. For top\-level programs given on the command\-line, the current directory is used\.
.
.P
Import directives can optionally specify a search path to which the default is appended\.
.
.P
The default search path is the search path given to the \fB\-L\fR command\-line option, else \fB["~/\.jq", "$ORIGIN/\.\./lib/jq", "$ORIGIN/\.\./lib"]\fR\.
.
.P
Null and empty string path elements terminate search path processing\.
.
.P
A dependency with relative path \fBfoo/bar\fR would be searched for in \fBfoo/bar\.jq\fR and \fBfoo/bar/bar\.jq\fR in the given search path\. This is intended to allow modules to be placed in a directory along with, for example, version control files, README files, and so on, but also to allow for single\-file modules\.
.
.P
Consecutive components with the same name are not allowed to avoid ambiguities (e\.g\., \fBfoo/foo\fR)\.
.
.P
For example, with \fB\-L$HOME/\.jq\fR a module \fBfoo\fR can be found in \fB$HOME/\.jq/foo\.jq\fR and \fB$HOME/\.jq/foo/foo\.jq\fR\.
.
.P
If \fB$HOME/\.jq\fR is a file, it is sourced into the main program\.
.
.SS "import RelativePathString as NAME [<metadata>];"
Imports a module found at the given path relative to a directory in a search path\. A \fB\.jq\fR suffix will be added to the relative path string\. The module\'s symbols are prefixed with \fBNAME::\fR\.
.
.P
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression\. It should be an object with keys like \fBhomepage\fR and so on\. At this time jq only uses the \fBsearch\fR key/value of the metadata\. The metadata is also made available to users via the \fBmodulemeta\fR builtin\.
.
.P
The \fBsearch\fR key in the metadata, if present, should have a string or array value (array of strings); this is the search path to be prefixed to the top\-level search path\.
.
.SS "include RelativePathString [<metadata>];"
Imports a module found at the given path relative to a directory in a search path as if it were included in place\. A \fB\.jq\fR suffix will be added to the relative path string\. The module\'s symbols are imported into the caller\'s namespace as if the module\'s content had been included directly\.
.
.P
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression\. It should be an object with keys like \fBhomepage\fR and so on\. At this time jq only uses the \fBsearch\fR key/value of the metadata\. The metadata is also made available to users via the \fBmodulemeta\fR builtin\.
.
.SS "import RelativePathString as $NAME [<metadata>];"
Imports a JSON file found at the given path relative to a directory in a search path\. A \fB\.json\fR suffix will be added to the relative path string\. The file\'s data will be available as \fB$NAME::NAME\fR\.
.
.P
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression\. It should be an object with keys like \fBhomepage\fR and so on\. At this time jq only uses the \fBsearch\fR key/value of the metadata\. The metadata is also made available to users via the \fBmodulemeta\fR builtin\.
.
.P
The \fBsearch\fR key in the metadata, if present, should have a string or array value (array of strings); this is the search path to be prefixed to the top\-level search path\.
.
.SS "module <metadata>;"
This directive is entirely optional\. It\'s not required for proper operation\. It serves only the purpose of providing metadata that can be read with the \fBmodulemeta\fR builtin\.
.
.P
The metadata must be a constant jq expression\. It should be an object with keys like \fBhomepage\fR\. At this time jq doesn\'t use this metadata, but it is made available to users via the \fBmodulemeta\fR builtin\.
.
.SS "modulemeta"
Takes a module name as input and outputs the module\'s metadata as an object, with the module\'s imports (including metadata) as an array value for the \fBdeps\fR key and the module\'s defined functions as an array value for the \fBdefs\fR key\.
.
.P
Programs can use this to query a module\'s metadata, which they could then use to, for example, search for, download, and install missing dependencies\.
.
.SH "COLORS"
To configure alternative colors just set the \fBJQ_COLORS\fR environment variable to colon\-delimited list of partial terminal escape sequences like \fB"1;31"\fR, in this order:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for \fBnull\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for \fBfalse\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for \fBtrue\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for numbers
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for strings
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for arrays
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for objects
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
color for object keys
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The default color scheme is the same as setting \fBJQ_COLORS="0;90:0;39:0;39:0;39:0;32:1;39:1;39:1;34"\fR\.
.
.P
This is not a manual for VT100/ANSI escapes\. However, each of these color specifications should consist of two numbers separated by a semi\-colon, where the first number is one of these:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
1 (bright)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
2 (dim)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4

jq \[en] Command\-line JSON processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]jq\f[R] \f[CR][\f[R]\f[I]OPTION\f[R]\f[CR]]\f[R]\&...
\f[I]FILTER\f[R] \f[CR][\f[R]\f[I]FILE\f[R]\f[CR]]\f[R]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
jq is a tool to transform JSON data in various ways, such as selecting,
iterating, and reducing.
For instance, running the command
\f[CR]jq \[aq]map(.price) | add\[aq]\f[R] takes an array of JSON objects
as input and returns the sum of their \[lq]price\[rq] fields.
.PP
A jq program, such as \f[CR]map(.price) | add\f[R], is called a
\f[I]filter\f[R].
Each filter takes an input value and produces a \f[I]stream\f[R] of
output values.
For instance, when the input value is an array, the filter
\f[CR].[]\f[R] yields all the elements of the array.
Even literals like \f[CR]\[dq]hello\[dq]\f[R] or \f[CR]42\f[R] are
filters \[em] they take an input and produce the same literal as output.
.PP
The simplest filter (or jq program) is identity \f[CR].\f[R], which
simply outputs its input.
Because the default behavior of jq is to pretty\-print all outputs, you
can use \f[CR]jq \[aq].\[aq]\f[R] to validate and pretty\-print JSON
input.
However, the jq programming language is quite rich and allows for much
more than just validation and pretty\-printing.
.PP
There are many filters for various standard tasks, such as extracting a
particular field of an object, or converting a number to a string.
.PP
Filters can be combined in various ways.
For example, you can feed the output of one filter to another filter, or
collect the output of a filter into an array.
Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration in other
languages are just done by gluing filters together in jq.
.PP
We can run a filter \f[CR]FILTER\f[R] using \f[CR]jq FILTER\f[R],
e.g.\ \f[CR]jq .foo\f[R].
For large filters, it may be more convenient to write it into some
\f[CR]FILE\f[R] and to run it with \f[CR]jq \-f FILE\f[R],
e.g.\ \f[CR]jq \-f filter.jq\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
When using \f[CR]jq FILTER\f[R], it is important to mind the shell\[cq]s
quoting rules.
As a general rule, it\[cq]s best to always quote the jq program, because
many characters with special meaning to jq are also shell
meta\-characters.
For example, \f[CR]jq \[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R] will fail on most Unix shells
because that will be the same as \f[CR]jq foo\f[R], which will generally
fail because \f[CR]foo is not defined\f[R].
The quoting rules depend on your shell: When using a Unix shell, use
single quotes around your jq program, When using the Windows command
shell (\f[CR]cmd.exe\f[R]), use \f[I]double quotes\f[R] around your jq
program and escape double quotes in the jq program with backslashes.
When using the Powershell (\f[CR]powershell.exe\f[R]) or the Powershell
Core (\f[CR]pwsh\f[R]/\f[CR]pwsh.exe\f[R]), use \f[I]single quotes\f[R]
around your jq program and escape double\-quotes in the jq program with
backslashes (\f[CR]\[rs]\[dq]\f[R]).

.PP
By default, jq reads a stream of JSON values (including numbers and
other literals) from a list of files (or \f[CR]stdin\f[R] if no files
are given), Whitespace is only needed to separate numbers (such as 1 and
2) and booleans (true and false).
Using \f[CR]\-\-raw\-input\f[R], jq accepts arbitrary text as input.
jq runs the given filter on each input value, and writes all output
values of the filter to standard output, as a sequence of
newline\-separated JSON values.
.SH COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
There exist several compilers/interpreters for the jq language; the
reference implementation is called jq, but there is also \c
.UR https://github.com/itchyny/gojq/
gojq
.UE \c
\ and \c
.UR https://github.com/01mf02/jaq
jaq
.UE \c
\&.
This manual tries to point out when these implementations diverge from
the reference implementation.
.PP
You can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output using some
command\-line options:
.SS General options
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-f filename\f[R] / \f[CR]\-\-from\-file filename\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Read filter from the file rather than from a command line, like
awk\[cq]s \f[CR]\-f\f[R] option.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-L directory\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Prepend \f[CR]directory\f[R] to the search paths for modules.
If this option is used then no builtin search paths are used.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-exit\-status\f[R] / \f[CR]\-e\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Sets the exit status of jq to 0 if the last output value was neither
\f[CR]false\f[R] nor \f[CR]null\f[R], 1 if the last output value was
either \f[CR]false\f[R] or \f[CR]null\f[R], or 4 if no valid result was
ever produced.
Normally jq exits with 2 if there was any usage problem or system error,
3 if there was a jq program compile error, or 0 if the jq program ran.
.PP
You can also set the exit status with the \f[CR]halt_error\f[R]
function.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-version\f[R] / \f[CR]\-V\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Output the jq version and exit with zero.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-help\f[R] / \f[CR]\-h\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Output the jq help and exit with zero.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Terminates argument processing.
Remaining arguments are not interpreted as options.
.RE
.SS Input options
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-null\-input\f[R] / \f[CR]\-n\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Don\[cq]t read any input at all.
Instead, the filter is run once using \f[CR]null\f[R] as the input.
This is useful when using jq as a simple calculator or to construct JSON
data from scratch.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-raw\-input\f[R] / \f[CR]\-R\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Don\[cq]t parse the input as JSON.
Instead, each line of text is passed to the filter as a string.
If combined with \f[CR]\-\-slurp\f[R], then the entire input is passed
to the filter as a single long string.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-slurp\f[R] / \f[CR]\-s\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the input, read
the entire input stream into a large array and run the filter just once.
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
When this option is used, jq combines the inputs of all files into one
single array, whereas jaq yields an array for every file.
This is motivated by jaq\[cq]s \f[CR]\-i\f[R] / \f[CR]\-\-in\-place\f[R]
option, which could not work with the slurping behaviour implemented by
jq.
The behaviour of jq can be approximated in jaq; for example, to achieve
the output of \f[CR]jq \-s . a b\f[R], you may use
\f[CR]jaq \-s . <(cat a b)\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Parse the input in streaming fashion, outputting arrays of path and leaf
values (scalars and empty arrays or empty objects).
For example, \f[CR]\[dq]a\[dq]\f[R] becomes \f[CR][[],\[dq]a\[dq]]\f[R],
and \f[CR][[],\[dq]a\[dq],[\[dq]b\[dq]]]\f[R] becomes
\f[CR][[0],[]]\f[R], \f[CR][[1],\[dq]a\[dq]]\f[R], and
\f[CR][[2,0],\[dq]b\[dq]]\f[R].
.PP
This is useful for processing large inputs incrementally, in particular
in conjunction with filtering and the \f[CR]reduce\f[R] and
\f[CR]foreach\f[R] filters.
.PP
Several builtin functions help processing streaming input.
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
jaq does not support this option.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-stream\-errors\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Like \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R], but invalid JSON inputs yield array values
where the first element is the error and the second is a path.
For example, \f[CR][\[dq]a\[dq],n]\f[R] produces
\f[CR][\[dq]Invalid literal at line 1, column 7\[dq],[1]]\f[R].
.PP
Implies \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R].
Invalid JSON inputs produce no error values when \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R]
without \f[CR]\-\-stream\-errors\f[R].

\f[CR]\-\-compact\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-c\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
By default, jq pretty\-prints JSON output.
Using this option will result in more compact output by instead putting
each JSON object on a single line.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-raw\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-r\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
With this option, if the filter\[cq]s result is a string then it will be
written directly to standard output rather than being formatted as a
JSON string with quotes.
This can be useful for making jq filters talk to non\-JSON\-based
systems.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-raw\-output0\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Like \f[CR]\-r\f[R] but jq will print NUL instead of newline after each
output.
This can be useful when the values being output can contain newlines.
When an output value contains NUL, jq exits with non\-zero code.

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-ascii\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-a\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
jq usually outputs non\-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF\-8, even if the
input specified them as escape sequences (like \[lq]3bc\[rq]).
Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII output with
every non\-ASCII character replaced with the equivalent escape sequence.

.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
jaq does not support this option.
However, you can sort all output objects by their keys using a filter
such as:

.PP
By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a terminal.
You can force it to produce color even if writing to a pipe or a file
using \f[CR]\-C\f[R], and disable color with \f[CR]\-M\f[R].
When the \f[CR]NO_COLOR\f[R] environment variable is not empty, jq
disables colored output by default, but you can enable it by
\f[CR]\-C\f[R].

Colors can be configured with the \f[CR]JQ_COLORS\f[R] environment
variable.

Use the \f[CR]application/json\-seq\f[R] MIME type scheme for separating

This means that an ASCII RS (record separator) character is printed
before each value on output and an ASCII LF (line feed) is printed after
every output.
Input JSON texts that fail to parse are ignored (but warned about),
discarding all subsequent input until the next RS.

.SH TYPES AND VALUES
jq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON \[em] booleans, numbers,
strings, arrays, objects (JSON\-speak for hashes with only string keys),
and \f[CR]null\f[R].
This section covers how to create values in jq.
.PP
\f[CR]null\f[R], booleans, numbers, and strings are written the same way
as in JSON.
Just like everything else in jq, these simple values take an input and
produce an output.
For example, \f[CR]42\f[R] is a valid jq expression that takes an input,
ignores it, and returns 42.
.SS Booleans
The booleans can be produced by the filters \f[CR]true\f[R] and
\f[CR]false\f[R].
.SS Numbers
Numbers in jq are internally represented by their IEEE754 double
precision approximation.
Any arithmetic operation with numbers, whether they are literals or
results of previous filters, will produce a double precision floating
point result.
.PP
However, when parsing a literal, jq stores the original literal string.
When a number which originally was provided as a literal is never
mutated until the end of the program, then its original literal form is
preserved.
This also includes cases when the original literal would be truncated
when converted to an IEEE754 double precision floating point number.
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
Using the current implementation of jq, the expression
\f[CR]1E1234567890\f[R] produces \f[CR]1.7976931348623157e+308\f[R] on
at least one platform.
This is because, in the process of parsing the number, jq has converted
it to an IEEE754 double\-precision representation, losing precision.
The way in which jq handles numbers has changed over time.
Further changes are likely within the parameters set by the relevant
JSON standards.
Moreover, build configuration options can alter how jq processes
numbers.
The following remarks are therefore offered with the understanding that
they are intended to be descriptive of the current version of jq and
should not be interpreted as being prescriptive:
.IP "(1)" 4
Any arithmetic operation on a number that has not already been converted
to an IEEE754 double precision representation will trigger a conversion
to the IEEE754 representation.
.IP "(2)" 4
jq will attempt to maintain the original decimal precision of number
literals (unless the \f[CR]\-\-disable\-decnum\f[R] build configuration
option was used), but in expressions such as \f[CR]1E1234567890\f[R],
precision will be lost if the exponent is too large.
.IP "(3)" 4
In jq programs, a leading minus sign triggers the conversion of the
number to an IEEE754 representation.
.IP "(4)" 4
Comparisons are carried out using the untruncated big decimal
representation of numbers if available, as illustrated in one of the
following examples.
See the builtin function \f[CR]have_decnum\f[R] for examples where the
\f[CR]\-\-disable\-decnum\f[R] build configuration option matters.
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
In gojq and jaq, numbers are either floating\-point numbers or integers.

.SS Strings
.SS String interpolation: \f[CR]\[rs](f)\f[R]
Inside a string, you can put a filter inside parentheses after a

.EE
.PP
The output of the filter will be interpolated into the string.

.EE
.SS String formatting: \f[CR]\[at]f\f[R]
The \f[CR]\[at]foo\f[R] syntax is used to format and escape strings,
which is useful for building URLs, documents in a language like HTML or
XML, and so forth.
\f[CR]\[at]foo\f[R] can also be used as a filter on its own.
See below for a list.
.PP
This syntax can be combined with string interpolation in a useful way.
You can follow a \f[CR]\[at]foo\f[R] token with a string literal.
The contents of the string literal will \f[I]not\f[R] be escaped.
However, all interpolations made inside that string literal will be
escaped.
For instance,
.IP
.EX
\[at]uri \[dq]https://www.google.com/search?q=\[rs](.search)\[dq]
.EE
.PP
will produce the following output for the input
\f[CR]{\[dq]search\[dq]:\[dq]what is jq?\[dq]}\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\[dq]https://www.google.com/search?q=what%20is%20jq%3F\[dq]

.SS Arrays: \f[CR][]\f[R]
As in JSON, \f[CR][]\f[R] is used to construct arrays, as in
\f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R].
The elements of the arrays can be any jq expression.
All of the results produced by all of the expressions are collected into
one big array.
You can use it to construct an array out of a known quantity of values
(as in \f[CR][.foo, .bar, .baz]\f[R]) or to \[lq]collect\[rq] all the
results of a filter into an array (as in \f[CR][.items[].name]\f[R])
.PP
Once you understand the concatenation operator (\f[CR],\f[R]), you can
look at jq\[cq]s array syntax in a different light: the expression
\f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] is not using a built\-in syntax for comma\-separated
arrays, but is instead applying the \f[CR][]\f[R] operator (collect
results) to the expression \f[CR]1,2,3\f[R] (which produces three
different results).
.PP
If you have a filter \f[CR]f\f[R] that produces four results, then the
expression \f[CR][f]\f[R] will produce a single result, an array of four
elements.

.SS Objects: \f[CR]{}\f[R]
Like JSON, \f[CR]{}\f[R] is for constructing objects (aka dictionaries
or hashes), as in: \f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]: 42, \[dq]b\[dq]: 17}\f[R].
.PP
If the keys are \[lq]identifier\-like\[rq], then the quotes can be left
off, as in \f[CR]{a:42, b:17}\f[R].
Variable references as key expressions use the value of the variable as
the key.
Key expressions other than constant literals, identifiers, or variable
references, need to be parenthesized, e.g.,
\f[CR]{(\[dq]a\[dq]+\[dq]b\[dq]):59}\f[R].
.PP
The value can be any expression (although you need to wrap it in
parentheses if it contains colons), which gets applied to the
\f[CR]{}\f[R] expression\[cq]s input (remember, all filters have an
input and an output).
For example,
.IP
.EX
{foo: .bar}
.EE
.PP
produces the JSON object \f[CR]{\[dq]foo\[dq]: 42}\f[R] if given the
JSON object \f[CR]{\[dq]bar\[dq]:42, \[dq]baz\[dq]:43}\f[R] as its
input.
You can use this to select particular fields of an object: if the input
is an object with \[lq]user\[rq], \[lq]title\[rq], \[lq]id\[rq], and
\[lq]content\[rq] fields and you just want \[lq]user\[rq] and
\[lq]title\[rq], you can write
.IP
.EX
{user: .user, title: .title}
.EE
.PP
Because that is so common, there\[cq]s a shortcut syntax for it:
\f[CR]{user, title}\f[R].
.PP
If one of the expressions produces multiple results, multiple
dictionaries will be produced.
If the input\[cq]s
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]user\[dq]:\[dq]stedolan\[dq],\[dq]titles\[dq]:[\[dq]JQ Primer\[dq], \[dq]More JQ\[dq]]}
.EE
.PP
then the expression
.IP
.EX
{user, title: .titles[]}
.EE
.PP
will produce two outputs:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]user\[dq]:\[dq]stedolan\[dq], \[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]JQ Primer\[dq]}
{\[dq]user\[dq]:\[dq]stedolan\[dq], \[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]More JQ\[dq]}
.EE
.PP
Putting parentheses around the key means it will be evaluated as an
expression.
With the same input as above,
.IP
.EX
{(.user): .titles}
.EE
.PP
produces
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]stedolan\[dq]: [\[dq]JQ Primer\[dq], \[dq]More JQ\[dq]]}
.EE
.PP
Variable references as keys use the value of the variable as the key.
Without a value then the variable\[cq]s name becomes the key and its
value becomes the value,
.IP
.EX
\[dq]f o o\[dq] as $foo | \[dq]b a r\[dq] as $bar | {$foo, $bar:$foo}

produces

.SH BASIC FILTERS
.SS Identity: \f[CR].\f[R]
The simplest filter is \f[CR].\f[R] and is called the \f[I]identity
operator\f[R].
This filter takes its input and produces the same value as output.
.PP
Since jq by default pretty\-prints all output, a trivial program
consisting of nothing but \f[CR].\f[R] can be used to format JSON output
from, say, \f[CR]curl\f[R].

.SS Concatenation: \f[CR],\f[R]
The \f[CR],\f[R] operator concatenates the outputs of two filters.
.PP
Given two filters \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R], their concatenation
\f[CR]f, g\f[R] first returns the outputs of \f[CR]f\f[R], then the
outputs of \f[CR]g\f[R].
The input of \f[CR]f, g\f[R] is fed to both \f[CR]f\f[R] and
\f[CR]g\f[R].

.SS Composition: \f[CR]|\f[R]
The \f[CR]|\f[R] operator feeds the output of one filter to another
filter.
It\[cq]s similar to the Unix shell\[cq]s pipe, if you\[cq]re used to
that.
.PP
Given two filters \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R], their composition
\f[CR]f | g\f[R] feeds the input of \f[CR]f | g\f[R] to \f[CR]f\f[R],
and for every output of \f[CR]f\f[R], feeds it to \f[CR]g\f[R] and
returns its outputs.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The expression \f[CR].[] | .foo\f[R] retrieves the \[lq]foo\[rq] field
of each element of the input array.
.PP
Note too that \f[CR].\f[R] is the input value at the particular stage in
a \[lq]pipeline\[rq], specifically: where the \f[CR].\f[R] expression
appears.
Thus \f[CR].a | . | .b\f[R] is the same as \f[CR].a.b\f[R], as the
\f[CR].\f[R] in the middle refers to whatever value \f[CR].a\f[R]
produced.

.SS Function call
jq provides many builtin functions for a variety of tasks, and you can
also define your own functions.
.PP
Each function has an \f[I]arity\f[R] that specifies how many
\f[I]arguments\f[R] that function takes.
For example, the function \f[CR]length\f[R] does not take any argument,
so its arity is 0, whereas the function \f[CR]contains\f[R] takes one
argument, so its arity is 1.
There may be several functions that have the same name, but different
arities; for example, there exist two functions called \f[CR]add\f[R],
taking zero and one arguments, respectively.
To unambiguously identify a function \f[CR]f\f[R] with arity
\f[CR]n\f[R], we write \f[CR]f/n\f[R], e.g.\ \f[CR]length/0\f[R],
\f[CR]contains/1\f[R], \f[CR]add/0\f[R], and \f[CR]add/1\f[R].
.PP
To call a function \f[CR]f\f[R] with no arguments (arity 0), we write
\f[CR]f\f[R].
To call a function \f[CR]f\f[R] with \f[CR]n\f[R] arguments (arity
greater than zero), we write \f[CR]f(a1; ...; an)\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
Function calls use semicolons \f[CR];\f[R] instead of commas
\f[CR],\f[R] to separate arguments, because \f[CR],\f[R] is already used
for concatenation.

Note that \f[CR]..a\f[R] does not work; use \f[CR].. | .a\f[R] instead.

.SH PATHS
In this section, we will show three very frequently used operators,
namely for iteration, indexing, and slicing.
These operators serve to obtain parts of values.
Furthermore, we will see how to combine these operators.
.SS Iteration operator: \f[CR].[]\f[R]
The operator \f[CR].[]\f[R] returns the values contained inside the
input value.
.PP
If the input is an array, then \f[CR].[]\f[R] returns all elements of
the array, and if the input is an object, \f[CR].[]\f[R] returns all the
values of the object.
For example, running \f[CR].[]\f[R] with the input \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R]
produces the numbers \f[CR]1 2 3\f[R] as three separate results, rather
than as a single array.

.SS Indexing operator: \f[CR].[f]\f[R]
When given an array as input, \f[CR].[n]\f[R] produces the
\f[CR]n\f[R]\-th element of the array.
For example, given the array \f[CR][2, 4, 6]\f[R], the filter
\f[CR].[1]\f[R] returns \f[CR]4\f[R].
Arrays are zero\-based, so \f[CR].[2]\f[R] returns the third element.
Negative indices are allowed, with \-1 referring to the last element,
\-2 referring to the next to last element, and so on.
.PP
When given a JSON object as input, \f[CR].[k]\f[R] produces the value at
the key \f[CR]k\f[R] if it is present in the object, or \f[CR]null\f[R]
otherwise.
For example, given the object
\f[CR]{name: \[dq]Anna\[dq], age: 24}\f[R], the filter
\f[CR].[\[dq]name\[dq]]\f[R] produces \f[CR]\[dq]Anna\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR].[\[dq]age\[dq]]\f[R] produces \f[CR]24\f[R], and
\f[CR].[\[dq]address\[dq]]\f[R] produces \f[CR]null\f[R].
.PP
We say that a key is \f[I]identifier\-like\f[R] when it does not start
with a digit and consists only of alphanumeric characters and
underscores; for example, \f[CR]\[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R] is identifier\-like.
For identifier\-like keys like \f[CR]\[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R], you can also
look up the field \f[CR]\[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R] of an object using the
shorthand syntax \f[CR].foo\f[R].
For example, we could have written \f[CR].name\f[R], \f[CR].age\f[R],
and \f[CR].address\f[R] above, whereas we cannot use this shorthand
syntax for \f[CR].[\[dq]foo::bar\[dq]]\f[R] and
\f[CR].[\[dq]foo.bar\[dq]]\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
In jq, when given \f[CR]null\f[R] input, \f[CR].[\[dq]a\[dq]]\f[R] and
\f[CR].[0]\f[R] yield \f[CR]null\f[R], but \f[CR].[]\f[R] yields an
error.
jaq yields an error in all cases to prevent accidental indexing of
\f[CR]null\f[R] values.
To obtain the same behaviour in jq and jaq, you can use
\f[CR].[\[dq]a\[dq]]? // null\f[R] or \f[CR].[0]? // null\f[R] instead.

.SS Slicing operator: \f[CR].[f:g]\f[R]
The operator \f[CR].[f:g]\f[R] returns a slice of an array or a string.
For example, when given an array, \f[CR].[10:15]\f[R] returns an array
of length 5, containing the elements from index 10 (inclusive) to index
15 (exclusive).
Either index may be negative, in which case it counts backwards from the
end of the array.
If \f[CR]f\f[R] is omitted, it is assumed to be \f[CR]0\f[R], and if
\f[CR]g\f[R] is omitted, it is assumed to be \f[CR]length\f[R].
Indices are zero\-based.

.SS Compound paths
Frequently, when using the path operators given above, we find ourselves
combining them with the \f[CR]|\f[R] and \f[CR]?\f[R] operators.
Therefore, jq provides shorthand syntax for these combinations.
For example:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR].key[]\f[R] for \f[CR].key | .[]\f[R],
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR].[].key?\f[R] for \f[CR].[] | .key?\f[R],
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR].[]?[]\f[R] for \f[CR].[]? | .[]\f[R],
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR].a.b\f[R] for \f[CR].a | .b\f[R],
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR].a.b.c\f[R] for \f[CR].a | .b | .c\f[R], and so on.
.PP
We call such a combination a \f[I]compound path\f[R].
.PP
The rules for what constitutes a compound path are surprisingly complex.
Therefore, we define it via a formal grammar in \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form
EBNF
.UE \c
:
.IP
.EX
path = atomic, part

     ;
.EE
.PP
Here, \f[CR]ident\f[R] refers to an identifier\-like key, \f[CR]t\f[R]
refers to a filter, and \f[CR]atomic\f[R] refers to an \f[I]atomic\f[R]
filter, such as \f[CR].\f[R] (identity), function call, and parenthesis.
This grammar defines a compound \f[CR]path\f[R] as a sequence of path
parts, potentially prefixed by an atomic root.
A path \f[CR]part\f[R] is any of the operators previously introduced in
this section.
(Note that \f[CR]part\f[R] does not include the leading \f[CR].\f[R] for
all operators except for \f[CR].ident\f[R].)
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The following is a compound path:
.IP
.EX
add[].posts[0]?.sections[][\[dq]title\[dq]]?
.EE
We can decompose it into its different parts:
.IP
.EX
add          # atomic (function call)
[]           # iteration
\&.posts       # indexing
[0]?         # indexing
\&.sections    # indexing
[]           # iteration
[\[dq]title\[dq]]?   # indexing
.EE
We can transform this into an equivalent filter:
.IP
.EX
  add
| .[]
| .posts
| .[0]?
| .sections
| .[]
| .[\[dq]title\[dq]]?
.EE
.PP
Filters inside a part of a compound path, such as \f[CR]f\f[R] and
\f[CR]g\f[R] in \f[CR].[f][:g]\f[R], are run with the \f[I]input given
to the whole path\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
When we run the filter \f[CR].arr[][.key]\f[R] on the input
\f[CR]{key: \[dq]a\[dq], arr: [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 3}]}\f[R], then
\f[CR].key\f[R] is run on the original input, not on the current value
returned by \f[CR].arr[]\f[R]!
To see the difference, let us first consider a \f[B]wrong\f[R]
transformation:

.SH ARITHMETIC AND COMPARISON
We are now going to introduce operators for arithmetic (\f[CR]+\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\f[R] \f[CR]*\f[R], \f[CR]/\f[R], \f[CR]%\f[R]), equality
(\f[CR]==\f[R], \f[CR]!=\f[R]), and ordering (\f[CR]<\f[R],
\f[CR]<=\f[R], \f[CR]>\f[R], \f[CR]>=\f[R]).
.PP
All operators in this section feed their input to both arguments and
combine their results.
This allows us to implement an averaging filter as
\f[CR]add / length\f[R] \[em] this feeds the input both to the
\f[CR]add\f[R] filter and the \f[CR]length\f[R] filter, then performs
the division of their results.
.PP
Given two filters \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R], we can write
\f[CR]f + g\f[R], \f[CR]f == g\f[R], \f[CR]f < g\f[R] and so on to
perform the desired operation on the outputs of the filters \f[CR]f\f[R]
and \f[CR]g\f[R].
When \f[CR]f\f[R] or \f[CR]g\f[R] outputs multiple values, then all
combinations of the operation are performed.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
Suppose that \f[CR]f\f[R] outputs the values \f[CR]1, 2\f[R] and
\f[CR]g\f[R] outputs the values \f[CR]3, 4\f[R].
Then \f[CR]f * g\f[R] outputs the values \f[CR]3, 6, 4, 8\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
For any operator in this section such as \f[CR]+\f[R], in jq ,
\f[CR]f + g\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR]g as $y | f as $x | $x + $y\f[R], whereas in jaq, \f[CR]f + g\f[R]
is equivalent to \f[CR]f as $x | g as $y | $x + $y\f[R].
That means that in the above example, jaq outputs the values
\f[CR]3, 4, 6, 8\f[R] instead of \f[CR]3, 6, 4, 8\f[R].
Note that this difference shows only when both \f[CR]f\f[R] and
\f[CR]g\f[R] produce multiple values.
.PP
Some jq operators (for instance, \f[CR]+\f[R]) do different things
depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers, etc.).
However, jq never does implicit type conversions.
Trying to add a string to an object results in an error.
.SS Addition: \f[CR]+\f[R]
The operator \f[CR]+\f[R] takes two filters, applies them both to the
same input, and adds the results together.
What \[lq]adding\[rq] means depends on the types involved:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Numbers\f[R] are added by normal arithmetic.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Arrays\f[R] are added by being concatenated into a larger array.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Strings\f[R] are added by being joined into a larger string.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Objects\f[R] are added by merging, that is, inserting all the
key\-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object.
If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object on the
right of the \f[CR]+\f[R] wins.
(For recursive merge use the \f[CR]*\f[R] operator.)
.PP
\f[CR]null\f[R] can be added to any value, and returns the other value
unchanged.

.SS Multiplication, division, modulo: \f[CR]*\f[R], \f[CR]/\f[R], \f[CR]%\f[R]
These infix operators behave as expected when given two numbers.
Division by zero raises an error.

.PP
Multiplying a string by a number produces the concatenation of that
string that many times.
\f[CR]\[dq]x\[dq] * 0\f[R] produces \f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
Dividing a string by another splits the first using the second as
separators.
.PP
Multiplying two objects will merge them recursively: this works like
addition but if both objects contain a value for the same key, and the
values are objects, the two are merged with the same strategy.

.SH BOOLEAN FILTERS
Every value can be converted to a boolean \[em] in particular, the
values \f[CR]false\f[R] and \f[CR]null\f[R] have the \f[I]boolean
value\f[R] \f[CR]false\f[R], all other values have the boolean value
\f[CR]true\f[R].
This section describes several filters that analyze the boolean value of
values.
.PP
You can negate the boolean value of a value with the builtin function
\f[CR]not\f[R].
It is called as a filter to which things can be piped rather than with
special syntax, as in \f[CR].foo and .bar | not\f[R].
.SS if\-then\-else\-end
The filter \f[CR]if i then t else e end\f[R] runs \f[CR]t\f[R] when
\f[CR]i\f[R] returns an output with boolean value \f[CR]true\f[R],
otherwise, it runs \f[CR]e\f[R].
.PP
Given three filters \f[CR]i\f[R], \f[CR]t\f[R], and \f[CR]e\f[R], the
expression \f[CR]if i then t else e end\f[R] runs \f[CR]i\f[R] on its
input.
For every value \f[CR]y\f[R] that is output by \f[CR]i\f[R], if
\f[CR]y\f[R] has the boolean value \f[CR]true\f[R] (that means, if
\f[CR]y\f[R] is neither \f[CR]false\f[R] nor \f[CR]null\f[R]), the
output of \f[CR]t\f[R] on the original input is produced, else the
output of \f[CR]e\f[R] on the original input is produced.
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
Checking for false or null is a simpler notion of \[lq]truthiness\[rq]
than is found in JavaScript or Python, but it means that you\[cq]ll
sometimes have to be more explicit about the condition you want.
You can\[cq]t test whether, e.g.\ a string is empty using
\f[CR]if .name then A else B end\f[R]; you\[cq]ll need something like
\f[CR]if .name == \[dq]\[dq] then A else B end\f[R] instead.
.PP
More cases can be added to an if using \f[CR]elif A then B\f[R] syntax.
.PP
\f[CR]if A then B end\f[R] is shorthand for
\f[CR]if A then B else .  end\f[R].
That is, the \f[CR]else\f[R] branch is optional, and if absent, it is
the same as \f[CR].\f[R].
This also applies to \f[CR]elif\f[R] with absent ending \f[CR]else\f[R]
branch.

The filter \f[CR]f or g\f[R] returns true if either \f[CR]f\f[R] or

Otherwise, both filters return \f[CR]false\f[R].
.PP
Given two filters \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R], their conjunction
\f[CR]f and g\f[R] and their disjunction \f[CR]f  or g\f[R] run
\f[CR]f\f[R] on the input, and for every output \f[CR]y\f[R] of
\f[CR]f\f[R], they analyze the boolean value \f[CR]y\f[R] of the output:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f and g\f[R] yields \f[CR]false\f[R] if \f[CR]y\f[R] is
\f[CR]false\f[R], otherwise it runs \f[CR]g\f[R] with the original input
and yields the boolean values of its outputs.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f or g\f[R] yields \f[CR]true\f[R] if \f[CR]y\f[R] is
\f[CR]true\f[R], otherwise it runs \f[CR]g\f[R] with the original input
and yields the boolean values of its outputs.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]true and false\f[R] returns \f[CR]false\f[R], whereas
\f[CR]true or false\f[R] returns \f[CR]true\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
These filters only produce the values \f[CR]true\f[R] and
\f[CR]false\f[R], rather than the common Perl/Python/Ruby idiom of
\[lq]value_that_may_be_null or default\[rq].

Given two filters \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R], the filter
\f[CR]f // g\f[R] runs \f[CR]f\f[R] on the input and yields all of its
outputs whose boolean value is \f[CR]true\f[R].
If the boolean values of all outputs of \f[CR]f\f[R] are
\f[CR]false\f[R] (which is also the case if \f[CR]f\f[R] does not yield
any output at all), then \f[CR]f // g\f[R] runs \f[CR]g\f[R] with the
original input and yields its outputs.
.PP
This is useful for providing defaults: \f[CR].foo // 1\f[R] evaluates to
\f[CR]1\f[R] if there\[cq]s no \f[CR].foo\f[R] element in the input.
It\[cq]s similar to how \f[CR]or\f[R] is sometimes used in Python
(jq\[cq]s \f[CR]or\f[R] operator is reserved for strictly Boolean

\f[CR]f // g\f[R] is not the same as \f[CR]f | (. // g)\f[R] (which can

# But if the error caught is not \[dq]break\[dq] then re\-raise it.

.PP
jq has a syntax for named lexical labels to \[lq]break\[rq] or \[lq]go
(back) to\[rq]:
.IP
.EX
label $out | ... break $out ...
.EE
.PP
The \f[CR]break $label_name\f[R] expression will cause the program to
act as though the nearest (to the left) \f[CR]label $label_name\f[R]
produced \f[CR]empty\f[R].
.PP
The relationship between the \f[CR]break\f[R] and corresponding
\f[CR]label\f[R] is lexical: the label has to be \[lq]visible\[rq] from
the break.
.PP
To break out of a \f[CR]reduce\f[R], for example:
.IP
.EX
label $out | reduce .[] as $item (null; if .==false then break $out else ... end)
.EE
.PP
The following jq program produces a syntax error:

.PP
because no label \f[CR]$out\f[R] is visible.
.SH VARIABLES
Variables are an absolute necessity in most programming languages, but
in jq, they can be considered an \[lq]advanced feature\[rq].
.PP
In most languages, variables are the only means of passing around data.
If you calculate a value, and you want to use it more than once,
you\[cq]ll need to store it in a variable.
To pass a value to another part of the program, you\[cq]ll need that
part of the program to define a variable (as a function parameter,
object member, or whatever) in which to place the data.
.PP
It is also possible to define functions in jq itself.
In fact, many of jq\[cq]s built\-in functions, including \f[CR]map\f[R]
and \f[CR]select\f[R], are written in jq.
.SS Variable binding: \f[CR]f as $x | g\f[R]
In jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual plumbing is
not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program to the next.
Many expressions, for instance \f[CR]a + b\f[R], pass their input to two
distinct subexpressions (here \f[CR]a\f[R] and \f[CR]b\f[R] are both
passed the same input), so variables aren\[cq]t usually necessary in
order to use a value twice.
.PP
For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers
requires a few variables in most languages \- at least one to hold the
array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter.
In jq, it\[cq]s simply \f[CR]add / length\f[R] \- the \f[CR]add\f[R]
expression is given the array and produces its sum, and the
\f[CR]length\f[R] expression is given the array and produces its length.
.PP
So, variables are often unnecessary and sometimes even best avoided, but
jq does let you define variables using the syntax \f[CR]f as $x\f[R].
All variable names start with \f[CR]$\f[R].
Here\[cq]s a slightly uglier version of the array\-averaging example:
.IP
.EX
length as $array_length | add / $array_length
.EE
.PP
We\[cq]ll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where
using variables actually makes our lives easier.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with \[lq]author\[rq] and
\[lq]title\[rq] fields, and another object which is used to map author
usernames to real names.
Our input looks like:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]posts\[dq]: [{\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]First post\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]anon\[dq]},
           {\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]A well\-written article\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]person1\[dq]}],
 \[dq]realnames\[dq]: {\[dq]anon\[dq]: \[dq]Anonymous Coward\[dq],
               \[dq]person1\[dq]: \[dq]Person McPherson\[dq]}}
.EE
We want to produce the posts with the author field containing a real
name, as in:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]First post\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]Anonymous Coward\[dq]}
{\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]A well\-written article\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]Person McPherson\[dq]}
.EE
We use a variable, \f[CR]$names\f[R], to store the realnames object, so
that we can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:
.IP
.EX
\&.realnames as $names | .posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]}
.EE
.PP
The filter \f[CR]f as $x | g\f[R] runs \f[CR]f\f[R] on its input, and
for each output \f[CR]y\f[R] produced by \f[CR]f\f[R], it runs
\f[CR]g\f[R] with the original input and with \f[CR]$x\f[R] set to
\f[CR]y\f[R].
Thus \f[CR]as\f[R] functions as something of a foreach loop.
.PP
Just as \f[CR]{foo}\f[R] is a handy way of writing
\f[CR]{foo: .foo}\f[R], so \f[CR]{$foo}\f[R] is a handy way of writing
\f[CR]{foo: $foo}\f[R].

.SS Scoping
There are three types of symbols in jq: variables, labels, and
functions.
All of these symbols are scoped lexically, with filters being able to
refer only to symbols that have been defined \[lq]to the left\[rq] of
them.
Furthermore, there is no way to change the value of a binding; one can
only create a new binding with the same name, but this will not be
visible where the old one was.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
In the filter
.IP
.EX
\&.realnames as $names | (.posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]})
.EE
the binding \f[CR]$names\f[R] is visible \[lq]to the right\[rq] of it,
but in the filter
.IP
.EX
(.realnames as $names | .posts[]) | {title, author: $names[.author]}
.EE
the binding \f[CR]$names\f[R] is \f[I]not\f[R] visible past the closing
parenthesis, so the filter is not well\-formed.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]1 as $x | (2 as $x | $x), $x\f[R] returns the values
\f[CR]2, 1\f[R].
First, it introduces a variable \f[CR]$x\f[R] via \f[CR]1 as $x\f[R],
then it introduces a variable \f[CR]$x\f[R] via \f[CR]2 as $x\f[R] that
\f[I]shadows\f[R] the previous \f[CR]$x\f[R].
However, because we limit the scope of \f[CR]2 as $x\f[R] with
parentheses, the final \f[CR]$x\f[R] refers to the original
\f[CR]1 as $x\f[R] again.
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
Labels and variables look alike, yet they live in different worlds.
To see this, consider the filter
\f[CR]1 as $x | label $x | $x, break $x, 2\f[R].
If the variable \f[CR]$x\f[R] and the label \f[CR]$x\f[R] would live in
the same world, then the label \f[CR]$x\f[R] would shadow the variable
\f[CR]$x\f[R].
However, because they live in different worlds, they do not shadow each
other, therefore this filter is syntactically correct and returns
\f[CR]1\f[R].
.SS Destructuring
Multiple variables may be declared using a single \f[CR]as\f[R]
expression by providing a pattern that matches the structure of the
input:
.IP
.EX
\&. as {realnames: $names, posts: [$first, $second]} | ...
.EE
.PP
The variable declarations in array patterns (e.g.,
\f[CR]. as [$first, $second]\f[R]) bind the elements of the array from
the element at index zero on up, in order.
When there is no value at the index for an array pattern element,
\f[CR]null\f[R] is bound to that variable.

.SS Destructuring alternative operator: \f[CR]?//\f[R]
The destructuring alternative operator provides a concise mechanism for
destructuring an input that can take one of several forms.
.PP
Suppose we have an API that returns a list of resources and events
associated with them, and we want to get the user_id and timestamp of
the first event for each resource.
The API (having been clumsily converted from XML) will only wrap the
events in an array if the resource has multiple events:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]resources\[dq]: [
  {\[dq]id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]kind\[dq]: \[dq]widget\[dq], \[dq]events\[dq]: {\[dq]action\[dq]: \[dq]create\[dq], \[dq]user_id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]ts\[dq]: 13}},
  {\[dq]id\[dq]: 2, \[dq]kind\[dq]: \[dq]widget\[dq], \[dq]events\[dq]: [
    {\[dq]action\[dq]: \[dq]create\[dq], \[dq]user_id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]ts\[dq]: 14},
    {\[dq]action\[dq]: \[dq]destroy\[dq], \[dq]user_id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]ts\[dq]: 15}
  ]}
]}
.EE
.PP
We can use the destructuring alternative operator to handle this
structural change simply:
.IP
.EX
\&.resources[] as {$id, $kind, events: {$user_id, $ts}} ?// {$id, $kind, events: [{$user_id, $ts}]} |
{$user_id, $kind, $id, $ts}
.EE
.PP
Or, if we aren\[cq]t sure if the input is an array of values or an
object:
.IP
.EX
\&.[] as [$id, $kind, $user_id, $ts] ?// {$id, $kind, $user_id, $ts} | ...
.EE
.PP
Each alternative need not define all of the same variables, but all
named variables will be available to the subsequent expression.
Variables not matched in the alternative that succeeded will be
\f[CR]null\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\&.resources[] as {$id, $kind, events: {$user_id, $ts}} ?// {$id, $kind, events: [{$first_user_id, $first_ts}]} |
{$user_id, $first_user_id, $kind, $id, $ts, $first_ts}
.EE
.PP
Additionally, if the subsequent expression returns an error, the
alternative operator will attempt to try the next binding.
Errors that occur during the final alternative are passed through.

.EE
.SH REDUCTION
jq has reduction operators, which can be used to run a filter on every
element of a stream while keeping some intermediate state.
These operators are used to define some bits of jq\[cq]s standard
library, such as \f[CR]add\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]reduce\f[R]
The \f[CR]reduce\f[R] syntax allows you to combine all of the results of
an expression by accumulating them into a single answer.
The form is \f[CR]reduce EXP as $var (INIT; UPDATE)\f[R].
As an example, we\[cq]ll pass \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] to this expression:
.IP
.EX
reduce .[] as $item (0; . + $item)
.EE
.PP
For each result that \f[CR].[]\f[R] produces, \f[CR]. + $item\f[R] is
run to accumulate a running total, starting from 0 as the input value.
In this example, \f[CR].[]\f[R] produces the results \f[CR]1\f[R],
\f[CR]2\f[R], and \f[CR]3\f[R], so the effect is similar to running
something like this:
.IP
.EX
0 | 1 as $item | . + $item |
    2 as $item | . + $item |
    3 as $item | . + $item
.EE
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
When \f[CR]UPDATE\f[R] yields multiple outputs, jq only considers the
\f[I]last\f[R] one for the next iteration, whereas jaq considers
\f[I]all\f[R] of them.
For example, the filter
.IP
.EX
reduce (0, 1) as $x ([]; . + ([\[dq]a\[dq], $x], [\[dq]b\[dq], $x]))
.EE
yields \f[CR][\[dq]b\[dq],0,\[dq]b\[dq],1]\f[R] in jq, whereas in jaq,
it yields:
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]a\[dq],0,\[dq]a\[dq],1]
[\[dq]a\[dq],0,\[dq]b\[dq],1]
[\[dq]b\[dq],0,\[dq]a\[dq],1]

.SS \f[CR]foreach\f[R]
The \f[CR]foreach\f[R] syntax is similar to \f[CR]reduce\f[R], but
intended to allow the construction of \f[CR]limit\f[R] and reducers that
produce intermediate results.
.PP
The form is \f[CR]foreach EXP as $var (INIT; UPDATE; EXTRACT)\f[R].
As an example, we\[cq]ll pass \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] to this expression:
.IP
.EX
foreach .[] as $item (0; . + $item; [$item, . * 2])
.EE
.PP
Like the \f[CR]reduce\f[R] syntax, \f[CR]. + $item\f[R] is run for each
result that \f[CR].[]\f[R] produces, but \f[CR][$item, . * 2]\f[R] is
run for each intermediate values.
In this example, since the intermediate values are \f[CR]1\f[R],
\f[CR]3\f[R], and \f[CR]6\f[R], the \f[CR]foreach\f[R] expression
produces \f[CR][1,2]\f[R], \f[CR][2,6]\f[R], and \f[CR][3,12]\f[R].
So the effect is similar to running something like this:
.IP
.EX
0 | 1 as $item | . + $item | [$item, . * 2],
    2 as $item | . + $item | [$item, . * 2],
    3 as $item | . + $item | [$item, . * 2]
.EE
.PP
When \f[CR]EXTRACT\f[R] is omitted, the identity filter is used.
That is, it outputs the intermediate values as they are.
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
jaq does not provide \f[CR]foreach/3\f[R], but it does provide
\f[CR]foreach/2\f[R].
Furthermore, similarly as for \f[CR]reduce\f[R], jq considers only the
\f[I]last\f[R] output of \f[CR]UPDATE\f[R] for the next iteration,
whereas jq considers \f[I]all\f[R] of them.
For example, the filter
.IP
.EX
foreach (0, 1) as $x ([]; . + ([\[dq]a\[dq], $x], [\[dq]b\[dq], $x]))
.EE
yields
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]a\[dq],0]
[\[dq]b\[dq],0]
[\[dq]b\[dq],0,\[dq]a\[dq],1]
[\[dq]b\[dq],0,\[dq]b\[dq],1]
.EE
in jq.
Here, we can see that jq actually yields both outputs of
\f[CR]UPDATE\f[R], namely \f[CR][\[dq]a\[dq],0]\f[R] and
\f[CR][\[dq]b\[dq],0]\f[R], but it only uses the last of them, namely
\f[CR][\[dq]b\[dq],0]\f[R], for the second iteration.
In contrast, jaq yields:
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]a\[dq],0]
[\[dq]a\[dq],0,\[dq]a\[dq],1]
[\[dq]a\[dq],0,\[dq]b\[dq],1]

.SH DEFINITIONS
When you have a filter \f[CR]g\f[R], you can give it a name \f[CR]f\f[R]
as follows:
.IP
.EX
def f: g;
.EE
.PP
This is called a \f[I]function definition\f[R].
Many builtin functions are implemented by definition.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The definition \f[CR]def increment: . + 1;\f[R] gives the filter
\f[CR]. + 1\f[R] the name \f[CR]increment\f[R].
.PP
A function definition \f[CR]def f: g;\f[R] that is followed by a filter
\f[CR]h\f[R] is a filter in which both \f[CR]g\f[R] and \f[CR]h\f[R] may
call \f[CR]f\f[R].
(Calls of \f[CR]f\f[R] in \f[CR]g\f[R] are recursive calls.)
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]def increment: . + 1; 2 | increment\f[R] is equivalent
to \f[CR]2 | . + 1\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
In jq, you can write definitions wherever you can write a filter.
That allows definitions in places that might be considered rather
unorthodox in other programming languages.
For example, you can write \f[CR]1 + def a: 2; def b: 3; a * b\f[R],
which is equivalent to \f[CR]1 + 2 * 3\f[R].
.PP
A function may take arguments, for example:
.IP
.EX
def map(f): [.[] | f];
.EE
.PP
Arguments are passed as \f[I]filters\f[R] (functions with no arguments),
\f[I]not\f[R] as values.
The same argument may be referenced multiple times with different
inputs; for example, in \f[CR]map\f[R], the argument \f[CR]f\f[R] is run
for each element of the input array.
Arguments to a function work more like callbacks than like value
arguments.
This is important to understand.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
Consider the following filter:
.IP
.EX
def foo(f): f|f;
5|foo(.*2)
.EE
The result will be 20 because \f[CR]f\f[R] is \f[CR].*2\f[R], and during
the first invocation of \f[CR]f\f[R] \f[CR].\f[R] will be 5, and the
second time it will be 10 (5 * 2), so the result will be 20.
.PP
If you want to pass an argument by value, you can prefix its name with
\f[CR]$\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The definition
.IP
.EX
def addvalue($f): map(. + $f);
.EE
is equivalent to
.IP
.EX
def addvalue(f): f as $f | map(. + $f);\[ga]
.EE
With either definition, \f[CR]addvalue(.foo)\f[R] adds the current
input\[cq]s \f[CR].foo\f[R] field to each element of the input.
.PP
Multiple definitions using the same function name are allowed.
Each re\-definition replaces the previous one for the same number of
function arguments, but only for references from functions (or main
program) subsequent to the re\-definition.
See also the section on scoping.

.SS Recursion
Any jq function can be recursive.
The subsection on recursion functions gives a few examples, such as
\f[CR]recurse\f[R].
.PP
Tail calls are optimized whenever the expression to the left of the
recursive call outputs its last value.
In practice this means that the expression to the left of the recursive
call should not produce more than one output for each input.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The builtin function \f[CR]repeat\f[R] can be naively implemented like
\f[CR]repeat_naive\f[R] below.
It is tail\-recursive, however, it binds \f[CR]f\f[R] to a new argument
whenever \f[CR]repeat_naive\f[R] is called recursively.
This makes \f[CR]f\f[R] more costly to call with every recursion step.
For that reason, \f[CR]repeat\f[R] is implemented like below, where
\f[CR]f\f[R] is bound only once, and the recursive call does not have to
perform any binding.
.IP
.EX
def repeat_naive(f):
    f, repeat_naive(f);

def repeat(f):
  def _repeat:
    f, _repeat;
  _repeat;
.EE
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The builtin function \f[CR]while\f[R] is also implemented recursively.
We apply a similar transformation as above for \f[CR]repeat\f[R] to keep
the cost of calls to \f[CR]cond\f[R] and \f[CR]update\f[R] constant:
.IP
.EX
def while_naive(cond; update):
    if cond
    then ., (update | while_naive(cond; update))
    else empty
    end;

def while (cond; update):
  def _while:
    if cond
    then ., (update | _while)
    else empty
    end;
  _while
.EE
.SS Generators and iterators
Some jq operators and functions are actually generators in that they can
produce zero, one, or more values for each input, just as one might
expect in other programming languages that have generators.
For example, \f[CR].[]\f[R] generates all the values in its input (which
must be an array or an object), \f[CR]range(0; 10)\f[R] generates the
integers between 0 and 10, and so on.
.PP
Even the comma operator is a generator, generating first the values
generated by the expression to the left of the comma, then the values
generated by the expression on the right of the comma.
.PP
The \f[CR]empty\f[R] builtin is the generator that produces zero
outputs.
The \f[CR]empty\f[R] builtin backtracks to the preceding generator
expression.
.PP
All jq functions can be generators just by using builtin generators.
It is also possible to construct new generators using only recursion and
the comma operator.
If recursive calls are \[lq]in tail position\[rq] then the generator
will be efficient.
In the example below the recursive call by \f[CR]_range\f[R] to itself
is in tail position.
The example shows off three advanced topics: tail recursion, generator
construction, and sub\-functions.

.SH ASSIGNMENT
jq provides a number of binary assignment operators, such as
\f[CR]|=\f[R] and \f[CR]=\f[R].
These replace parts of the input at positions given by the left\-hand
side with outputs given by the right\-hand side, then return the updated
input.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a: 1, b: 2} | (.a = 3)\f[R] outputs
\f[CR]{a: 3, b: 2}\f[R].
Here, we replaced the value at position \f[CR].a\f[R] with 3.
.PP
All values in jq are immutable.
That means that the input to an assignment is not actually changed;
instead, you can think of an assignment creating a \f[I]copy\f[R] of its
input before changing it, then returning the changed copy.
The original input remains the same.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a:{b:{c:1}}} | (.a.b = 3), .\f[R] outputs
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]:{\[dq]b\[dq]:3}}\f[R] and
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]:{\[dq]b\[dq]:{\[dq]c\[dq]:1}}}\f[R], because the last
sub\-expression, \f[CR].\f[R], sees the original value, not the modified
value.
.PP
We can use any kind of compound path that starts with \f[CR].\f[R] on
the left\-hand side of an assignment, such as \f[CR].[].a\f[R] or
\f[CR].[0]\f[R].
We\[cq]ll discuss usage of other filters on the left\-hand side in
complex assignments.
.SS Update assignment: \f[CR]|=\f[R]
For every position returned by \f[CR]p\f[R], the update operator
\f[CR]p |= f\f[R] replaces the value \f[CR]v\f[R] at that position by
the output of \f[CR]f\f[R] applied to \f[CR]v\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{foo: 1, bar: 3} | .foo |= .+1\f[R] builds an object
with the \f[CR]foo\f[R] field set to the input\[cq]s \f[CR]foo\f[R] plus
1, resulting in the output \f[CR]{foo: 2, bar: 3}\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR][1, 2, 3] | .[] |= . + 1\f[R] returns
\f[CR][2, 3, 4]\f[R].
Here, \f[CR].[]\f[R] returns multiple positions, and the values at each
of these positions are updated with \f[CR]. + 1\f[R].
.PP
If the right\-hand side outputs no values (i.e., \f[CR]empty\f[R]), then
the value at the current position is deleted, as with
\f[CR]del(path)\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a: 1, b: 2} | .a |= empty\f[R] returns
\f[CR]{b: 2}\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR][1, 2, 3] | .[0] |= empty\f[R] returns
\f[CR][2, 3]\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR][1, 2, 3, 4] | .[] |= select(. % 2 == 0)\f[R] returns
\f[CR][2, 4]\f[R].
That means that we can use assignments to filter values from arrays and
objects.
.PP
If the right\-hand side outputs multiple values, only the first output
is used.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a: 1} | .a |= (2, 3)\f[R] yields \f[CR]{a: 2}\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
In jq 1.5 and earlier releases, only the last output was used.
.SS Plain assignment: \f[CR]=\f[R]
The plain assignment operator \f[CR]=\f[R] differs from \f[CR]|=\f[R] in
two main points: First, the input to the right\-hand side is the same as
the input to the left\-hand side, not the current value returned by the
left\-hand side.
Second, when the right\-hand side returns multiple values, then the
operation is performed for each of these values.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
To see the difference between \f[CR]=\f[R] and \f[CR]|=\f[R], let us
provide the input
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]: {\[dq]b\[dq]: 10}, \[dq]b\[dq]: 20}\f[R] to the
programs \f[CR].a = .b\f[R] and \f[CR].a |= .b\f[R].
The former sets the \f[CR]a\f[R] field of the input to the \f[CR]b\f[R]
field of the input, producing the output
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]: 20, \[dq]b\[dq]: 20}\f[R].
The latter sets the \f[CR]a\f[R] field of the input to the \f[CR]a\f[R]
field\[cq]s \f[CR]b\f[R] field, producing
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]: 10, \[dq]b\[dq]: 20}\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a: 1} | .a = (2, 3)\f[R] yields two outputs, namely
\f[CR]{a: 2}\f[R] and \f[CR]{a: 3}\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]a = b\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR]b as $x | a |= $x\f[R] (where \f[CR]$x\f[R] is a fresh variable
name).
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
Assignment works a little differently in jq than in most programming
languages.
jq does not distinguish between references to and copies of something
\[em] two objects or arrays are either equal or not equal, without any
further notion of being \[lq]the same object\[rq] or \[lq]not the same
object\[rq].
If an object has two fields, \f[CR].foo\f[R] and \f[CR].bar\f[R], and
you set \f[CR].bar = .foo\f[R], then changing \f[CR].foo\f[R] does not
impact \f[CR].bar\f[R].
If you\[cq]re used to programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby,
JavaScript, etc., then you can think of it as though jq does a full deep
copy of every object before it does the assignment (for performance it
doesn\[cq]t actually do that, but that\[cq]s the general idea).
This means that it\[cq]s impossible to build circular values in jq (such
as an array whose first element is itself).
This is quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jq program
produces can be represented in JSON.
.PP
Most users will want to use modification assignment operators, such as
\f[CR]|=\f[R] or \f[CR]+=\f[R], rather than \f[CR]=\f[R].

jq has a few operators of the form \f[CR]a op= b\f[R].
So, \f[CR]+= 1\f[R] can be used to increment values, being the same as
\f[CR]|= . + 1\f[R].
.PP
Like \f[CR]=\f[R], the right\-hand side of an arithmetic update operator
receives the same input as the left\-hand side, and when the right\-hand
side returns multiple values, then the operation is performed for each
of these values.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a: 1, b: 2} | .a += .b\f[R] yields
\f[CR]{a: 3, b: 2}\f[R], because \f[CR].b\f[R] was executed on the
original input (\f[CR]{a: 1, b: 2}\f[R]), not on the value that it
updated (\f[CR]1\f[R]).
In contrast, \f[CR]{a: 1, b: 2} | .a |= . + .b\f[R] yields an error,
because \f[CR].b\f[R] is executed on the value \f[CR]1\f[R] found at the
position \f[CR].a\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{a: 1} | .a += (1, 2)\f[R] yields two outputs, namely

.SS Complex assignments
jq accepts far more expressions on the left\-hand side of assignments
than most languages.
So far, we have seen assignments using simple path operators such as
\f[CR].[0]\f[R] and \f[CR].a\f[R] on the left\-hand side.
We are now going to show more complex filters on the left\-hand side.
.PP
First, we can write any compound path on the left\-hand side of an
update.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
Suppose that the input is an object with a field \[lq]posts\[rq] which
is an array of posts.
The filter \f[CR].posts[0].title = \[dq]JQ Manual\[dq]\f[R] sets the
\[lq]title\[rq] field of the first post.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR].posts[].comments += [\[dq]this is great\[dq]]\f[R]
appends the string \[lq]this is great\[rq] to the \[lq]comments\[rq]
array of \f[I]each\f[R] post in the input.
.PP
In general, on the left\-hand side of an assignment, we can use filters
that evaluate to a \f[I]concatenation of compound paths\f[R], where each
of these compound paths must start with \f[CR].\f[R].
We call such filters \f[I]path expressions\f[R].
.PP
When jq evaluates an assignment, it tries to evaluate its left\-hand
side to a concatenation of compound paths.
If it succeeds, it updates the values at the positions corresponding to
these paths.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
Suppose we want to add a comment to blog posts, using the same
\[lq]blog\[rq] input as above.
This time, we only want to comment on the posts written by
\[lq]stedolan\[rq].
We can find the comments for these posts using the \[lq]select\[rq]
function described earlier:
.IP
.EX
\&.posts[] | select(.author == \[dq]stedolan\[dq]) | .comments
.EE
We can evaluate this to a concatenation of compound paths \[em] for
example, if the 3rd and 42th post were written by \[lq]stedolan\[rq],
this would yield \f[CR].posts[3].comments, .posts[42].comments\f[R].
We can therefore use this on the left\-hand side of an assignment, such
as:
.IP
.EX
(.posts[] | select(.author == \[dq]stedolan\[dq]) | .comments) += [\[dq]terrible.\[dq]]
.EE
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]$var.foo = 1\f[R] yields an error, because
\f[CR]$var.foo\f[R] is a compound path that starts with \f[CR]$var\f[R],
not with \f[CR].\f[R].
Therefore, this path does not point to the input of the assignment.
You can use \f[CR]$var | .foo = 1\f[R] instead.
.TP
\f[I]Example\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]{foo: 1, bar: 2} | (.foo, .bar) |= .+1\f[R] builds an
object with the \f[CR]foo\f[R] field set to the input\[cq]s
\f[CR]foo\f[R] plus 1, and the \f[CR]bar\f[R] field set to the
input\[cq]s \f[CR]bar\f[R] plus 1.
Its output is \f[CR]{foo: 2, bar: 3}\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
Due to precedence rules, \f[CR].a,.b=0\f[R] does not set \f[CR].a\f[R]
and \f[CR].b\f[R], because it is equivalent to \f[CR].a, (.b=0)\f[R].
The filter \f[CR](.a,.b)=0\f[R] sets both.

.SS Path expressions
We now show which kinds of filters are path expressions, i.e.
which filters can be used on the left\-hand side of assignments.
.PP
The following filters are path expressions:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR].\f[R] (identity)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]..\f[R] (recursive descent)
.IP \[bu] 2
compound path: if it starts with some \f[CR]f\f[R], then \f[CR]f\f[R]
must be a path expression
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
(\f[CR].[]\f[R] is a path expression because it starts with
\f[CR].\f[R], which is a path expression)
.IP \[bu] 2
(\f[CR]{}[]\f[R] is \f[I]not\f[R] a path expression, because it starts
with \f[CR]{}\f[R], which is no path expression)
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]if i then t else e end\f[R]: if \f[CR]i\f[R] and \f[CR]e\f[R] are
path expressions
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f as $x | g\f[R]: if \f[CR]g\f[R] is a path expression
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f, g\f[R]: if \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R] are path expressions
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f | g\f[R]: if \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R] are path expressions
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f // g\f[R]: if \f[CR]f\f[R] and \f[CR]g\f[R] are path expressions
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]f?\f[R]: if \f[CR]f\f[R] is a path expression
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]label $x | f\f[R]: if \f[CR]f\f[R] is a path expression
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]break $x\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]def f: g; h\f[R] (function definition): if \f[CR]h\f[R] is a path
expression
.PP
On the contrary, the following filters output values which do
\f[I]not\f[R] point to a part of their input, therefore they are
\f[I]no\f[R] path expressions:
.IP \[bu] 2
new values, e.g.\ \f[CR]1\f[R], \[lq]Hello world\[rq],
\f[CR][1, 2]\f[R], \f[CR]{a: 1}\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
arithmetic and comparison operations, e.g.\ \f[CR]. + 1\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]and\f[R], \f[CR]or\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]$x\f[R] (variable)
.IP \[bu] 2
assignment (\f[CR]|=\f[R], \f[CR]=\f[R], \f[CR]+=\f[R], \&...)
.PP
For function calls, it depends on the function: If the function is
implemented by definition and its definition is a path expression, then
the function call is a path expression as well.
For example, this is the case for select) and recurse.
However, most builtin functions return outputs that do not point to a
part of their input, so calls to them are no path expressions.
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
This characterisation of path expressions is an
\f[I]underapproximation\f[R]; that is, there are filters that do not
correspond to these criteria, yet they can be used on the left\-hand
side of assignments.
For example, our criteria do not say that the filter
\f[CR]if true then empty else 0 end\f[R] is a path expression, because
\f[CR]0\f[R] is not a path expression.
Despite this, we can happily use this filter on the left\-hand side of
an assignment.
Such an assignment will always return its input, because
\f[CR]if true then empty else 0 end\f[R] always evaluates to
\f[CR]empty\f[R], so jq does not attempt to evaluate \f[CR]0\f[R] as
path.
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
jaq\[cq]s approach to handling assignments is quite different from that
of jq and gojq.
Specifically, jaq executes assignments without constructing compound
paths.
This means that jaq does not allow certain filters on the left\-hand
side of assignments, notably \f[CR]f?\f[R] and \f[CR]label $x | f\f[R].
jaq\[cq]s approach is generally more performant, but in certain
scenarios, jaq and jq will produce different results, in particular when
using \f[CR]f |= empty\f[R].
However, for the examples in this section, jq and jaq yield the same
outputs.
.SH MANAGING LARGE PROGRAMS
.SS Comments
You can write comments in your jq programs using \f[CR]#\f[R].
.PP
A \f[CR]#\f[R] character (not part of a string) starts a comment.
All characters from \f[CR]#\f[R] to the end of the line are ignored.
.PP
If the end of the line is preceded by an odd number of backslash
characters, the following line is also considered part of the comment
and is ignored.
.PP
For example, the following code outputs \f[CR][1,3,4,7]\f[R]
.IP
.EX
[
  1,
  # foo \[rs]
  2,
  # bar \[rs]\[rs]
  3,

  6,
  7
  # comment \[rs]
    comment \[rs]
    comment

.EE
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
A backslash continuing the comment on the next line can be useful when
writing the \[lq]shebang\[rq] for a jq script:
.IP
.EX
#!/bin/sh \-\-
# total \- Output the sum of the given arguments (or stdin)
# usage: total [numbers...]
# \[rs]

  . as $dot |
  try tonumber catch false |
  if not or isnan then
    \[at]json \[dq]total: Invalid number \[rs]($dot).\[rs]n\[dq] | halt_error(1)
  end
) as $n (0; . + $n)
.EE
The \f[CR]exec\f[R] line is considered a comment by jq, so it is
ignored.
But it is not ignored by \f[CR]sh\f[R], since in \f[CR]sh\f[R] a
backslash at the end of the line does not continue the comment.
With this trick, when the script is invoked as \f[CR]total 1 2\f[R],
\f[CR]/bin/sh \-\- /path/to/total 1 2\f[R] will be run, and
\f[CR]sh\f[R] will then run
\f[CR]exec jq \-\-args \-MRnf /path/to/total \-\- 1 2\f[R] replacing
itself with a \f[CR]jq\f[R] interpreter invoked with the specified
options (\f[CR]\-M\f[R], \f[CR]\-R\f[R], \f[CR]\-n\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\-args\f[R]), that evaluates the current file (\f[CR]$0\f[R]),
with the arguments (\f[CR]$\[at]\f[R]) that were passed to
\f[CR]sh\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
jaq ignores backslashes at the end of comment lines.
.SS Modules
jq has a library/module system.
Modules are files whose names end in \f[CR].jq\f[R].
.SS Importing / including modules
The directives
.IP
.EX
import RelativePathString as NAME [<metadata>];
include RelativePathString [<metadata>];
.EE
.PP
import a module found at the given path relative to a directory in a
search path.
A \f[CR].jq\f[R] suffix will be added to the relative path string.
If \f[CR]import\f[R] is used, the module\[cq]s symbols are prefixed with
\f[CR]NAME::\f[R].
If \f[CR]include\f[R] is used, the module\[cq]s symbols are imported
into the caller\[cq]s namespace.
.PP
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression.
It should be an object with keys like \f[CR]homepage\f[R] and so on.
At this time jq only uses the \f[CR]search\f[R] key/value of the
metadata.
The metadata is also made available to users via the
\f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.PP
The \f[CR]search\f[R] key in the metadata, if present, should have a
string or array value (array of strings); this is the search path to be
prefixed to the top\-level search path.
.SS Importing data
The directive
.IP
.EX
import RelativePathString as $NAME [<metadata>];
.EE
.PP
imports a JSON file found at the given path relative to a directory in a
search path.
A \f[CR].json\f[R] suffix will be added to the relative path string.
The file\[cq]s data will be available as \f[CR]$NAME::NAME\f[R].
.PP
The optional metadata is considered the same way as module imports.
.SS Providing module metadata
The directive
.IP
.EX
module <metadata>;
.EE
.PP
may be put at the beginning of a module file.
It is entirely optional and serves only the purpose of providing
metadata that can be read with the \f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.PP
The metadata must be a constant jq expression.
It should be an object with keys like \f[CR]homepage\f[R].
At this time jq doesn\[cq]t use this metadata, but it is made available
to users via the \f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.SS Search paths
Modules imported by a program are searched for in a default search path
(see below).
The \f[CR]import\f[R] and \f[CR]include\f[R] directives allow the
importer to alter this path.
.PP
Paths in the search path are subject to various substitutions:
.IP \[bu] 2
For paths starting with \f[CR]\[ti]/\f[R], the user\[cq]s home directory
is substituted for \f[CR]\[ti]\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
For paths starting with \f[CR]$ORIGIN/\f[R], the directory where the jq
executable is located is substituted for \f[CR]$ORIGIN\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
For paths starting with \f[CR]./\f[R] or paths that are \f[CR].\f[R],
the path of the including file is substituted for \f[CR].\f[R].
For top\-level programs given on the command\-line, the current
directory is used.
.PP
Import directives can optionally specify a search path to which the
default is appended.
.PP
The default search path is the search path given to the \f[CR]\-L\f[R]
command\-line option, else
\f[CR][\[dq]\[ti]/.jq\[dq], \[dq]$ORIGIN/../lib/jq\[dq], \[dq]$ORIGIN/../lib\[dq]]\f[R].
.PP
Null and empty string path elements terminate search path processing.
.PP
A dependency with relative path \f[CR]foo/bar\f[R] would be searched for
in \f[CR]foo/bar.jq\f[R] and \f[CR]foo/bar/bar.jq\f[R] in the given
search path.
This is intended to allow modules to be placed in a directory along
with, for example, version control files, README files, and so on, but
also to allow for single\-file modules.
.PP
Consecutive components with the same name are not allowed to avoid
ambiguities (e.g., \f[CR]foo/foo\f[R]).
.PP
For example, with \f[CR]\-L$HOME/.jq\f[R] a module \f[CR]foo\f[R] can be
found in \f[CR]$HOME/.jq/foo.jq\f[R] and

.SS \f[CR]empty\f[R]
\f[CR]empty\f[R] returns no results.
None at all.
Not even \f[CR]null\f[R].

.SS \f[CR]length\f[R]
The \f[CR]length\f[R] function gets the length of various different
types of values:
.IP \[bu] 2
The length of a \f[B]string\f[R] is the number of Unicode codepoints it
contains (which will be the same as its JSON\-encoded length in bytes if
it\[cq]s pure ASCII).
.IP \[bu] 2
The length of a \f[B]number\f[R] is its absolute value.
.IP \[bu] 2
The length of an \f[B]array\f[R] is the number of elements.
.IP \[bu] 2
The length of an \f[B]object\f[R] is the number of key\-value pairs.
.IP \[bu] 2
The length of \f[B]null\f[R] is zero.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is an error to use \f[CR]length\f[R] on a \f[B]boolean\f[R].

.SS \f[CR]keys\f[R], \f[CR]keys_unsorted\f[R]
The builtin function \f[CR]keys\f[R], when given an object, returns its
keys in an array.
.PP
The keys are sorted \[lq]alphabetically\[rq], by unicode codepoint
order.
This is not an order that makes particular sense in any particular
language, but you can count on it being the same for any two objects
with the same set of keys, regardless of locale settings.
.PP
When \f[CR]keys\f[R] is given an array, it returns the valid indices for
that array: the integers from 0 to length\-1.
.PP
The \f[CR]keys_unsorted\f[R] function is just like \f[CR]keys\f[R], but
if the input is an object then the keys will not be sorted, instead the
keys will roughly be in insertion order.

.SS \f[CR]map(f)\f[R], \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R]
For any filter \f[CR]f\f[R], \f[CR]map(f)\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] apply \f[CR]f\f[R] to each of the values in the
input array or object, that is, to the values of \f[CR].[]\f[R].
.PP
In the absence of errors, \f[CR]map(f)\f[R] always outputs an array
whereas \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] outputs an array if given an array, or
an object if given an object.
.PP
When the input to \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] is an object, the output
object has the same keys as the input object except for those keys whose
values when piped to \f[CR]f\f[R] produce no values at all.
.PP
The key difference between \f[CR]map(f)\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] is that the former simply forms an array from
all the values of \f[CR]($x|f)\f[R] for each value, \f[CR]$x\f[R], in
the input array or object, but \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] only uses
\f[CR]first($x|f)\f[R].
.PP
Specifically, for object inputs, \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] constructs the
output object by examining in turn the value of
\f[CR]first(.[$k]|f)\f[R] for each key, \f[CR]$k\f[R], of the input.
If this expression produces no values, then the corresponding key will
be dropped; otherwise, the output object will have that value at the
key, \f[CR]$k\f[R].
.PP
Here are some examples to clarify the behavior of \f[CR]map\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values\f[R] when applied to arrays.
These examples assume the input is \f[CR][1]\f[R] in all cases:
.IP
.EX
map(.+1)          #=>  [2]
map(., .)         #=>  [1,1]
map(empty)        #=>  []

map_values(.+1)   #=>  [2]
map_values(., .)  #=>  [1]
map_values(empty) #=>  []
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]map(f)\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR][.[] | f]\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR].[] |= f\f[R].
.PP
In fact, these are their implementations.

.EE
.SS \f[CR]to_entries\f[R], \f[CR]from_entries\f[R], \f[CR]with_entries(f)\f[R]
These functions convert between an object and an array of key\-value
pairs.
If \f[CR]to_entries\f[R] is passed an object, then for each
\f[CR]k: v\f[R] entry in the input, the output array includes
\f[CR]{\[dq]key\[dq]: k, \[dq]value\[dq]: v}\f[R].
.PP
\f[CR]from_entries\f[R] does the opposite conversion, and
\f[CR]with_entries(f)\f[R] is a shorthand for
\f[CR]to_entries | map(f) | from_entries\f[R], useful for doing some
operation to all keys and values of an object.
\f[CR]from_entries\f[R] accepts \f[CR]\[dq]key\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]Key\[dq]\f[R], \f[CR]\[dq]name\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]Name\[dq]\f[R], \f[CR]\[dq]value\[dq]\f[R], and

.EE
.SS \f[CR]select(boolean_expression)\f[R]
The function \f[CR]select(f)\f[R] produces its input unchanged if

otherwise.

.SS Path expression functions
The following functions all take a path expression.
.SS \f[CR]path(path_expression)\f[R]
Outputs array representations of the given path expression in
\f[CR].\f[R].
The outputs are arrays of strings (object keys) and/or numbers (array
indices).
The outputs of this function can be processed with path functions.
.PP
Path expressions are jq expressions like \f[CR].a\f[R], but also
\f[CR].[]\f[R].
There are two types of path expressions: ones that can match exactly,
and ones that cannot.
For example, \f[CR].a.b.c\f[R] is an exact match path expression, while
\f[CR].a[].b\f[R] is not.
.PP
\f[CR]path(exact_path_expression)\f[R] will produce the array
representation of the path expression even if it does not exist in
\f[CR].\f[R], if \f[CR].\f[R] is \f[CR]null\f[R] or an array or an
object.
.PP
\f[CR]path(pattern)\f[R] will produce array representations of the paths
matching \f[CR]pattern\f[R] if the paths exist in \f[CR].\f[R].
.PP
Note that the path expressions are not different from normal
expressions.
The expression \f[CR]path(..|select(type==\[dq]boolean\[dq]))\f[R]
outputs all the paths to boolean values in \f[CR].\f[R], and only those
paths.

.SS Number functions
jq currently only has IEEE754 double\-precision (64\-bit) floating point
number support.
.PP
Besides simple arithmetic operators such as \f[CR]+\f[R], jq also has
most standard math functions from the C math library.
C math functions that take a single input argument (e.g.,
\f[CR]sin()\f[R]) are available as zero\-argument jq functions.
C math functions that take two input arguments (e.g., \f[CR]pow()\f[R])
are available as two\-argument jq functions that ignore \f[CR].\f[R].
C math functions that take three input arguments are available as
three\-argument jq functions that ignore \f[CR].\f[R].
.PP
Availability of standard math functions depends on the availability of
the corresponding math functions in your operating system and C math
library.
Unavailable math functions will be defined but will raise an error.

When given an array \f[CR][x0, x1, ..., xn]\f[R], in jq,
\f[CR]join(x)\f[R] converts all elements of the input array to strings
and intersperses them with \f[CR]x\f[R], whereas in jaq,
\f[CR]join(x)\f[R] simply calculates
\f[CR]x0 + x + x1 + x + ... + xn\f[R].
When all elements of the input array and \f[CR]x\f[R] are strings, jq

.SS \f[CR]recurse(f)\f[R], \f[CR]recurse\f[R], \f[CR]recurse(f; condition)\f[R]
The \f[CR]recurse(f)\f[R] function allows you to search through a
recursive structure, and extract interesting data from all levels.
Suppose your input represents a filesystem:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]/\[dq], \[dq]children\[dq]: [
  {\[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]/bin\[dq], \[dq]children\[dq]: [

Now suppose you want to extract all of the filenames present.
You need to retrieve \f[CR].name\f[R], \f[CR].children[].name\f[R],
\f[CR].children[].children[].name\f[R], and so on.
You can do this with:
.IP
.EX
recurse(.children[]) | .name
.EE
.PP
When called without an argument, \f[CR]recurse\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR]recurse(.[]?)\f[R].
.PP
\f[CR]recurse(f)\f[R] is identical to \f[CR]recurse(f; true)\f[R] and
can be used without concerns about recursion depth.
.PP
\f[CR]recurse(f; condition)\f[R] is a generator which begins by emitting
\&.
and then emits in turn .|f, .|f|f, .|f|f|f, \&...
so long as the computed value satisfies the condition.
For example, to generate all the integers, at least in principle, one
could write \f[CR]recurse(.+1; true)\f[R].
.PP
The recursive calls in \f[CR]recurse\f[R] will not consume additional

.SS \f[CR]walk(f)\f[R]
The \f[CR]walk(f)\f[R] function applies f recursively to every component
of the input entity.
When an array is encountered, f is first applied to its elements and
then to the array itself; when an object is encountered, f is first
applied to all the values and then to the object.
In practice, f will usually test the type of its input, as illustrated
in the following examples.
The first example highlights the usefulness of processing the elements
of an array of arrays before processing the array itself.
The second example shows how all the keys of all the objects within the
input can be considered for alteration.

Oniguruma regular expression library
.UE \c

.EE
.PP
where:
.IP \[bu] 2
STRING, REGEX, and FLAGS are jq strings and subject to jq string
interpolation;
.IP \[bu] 2
REGEX, after string interpolation, should be a valid regular expression;
.IP \[bu] 2
FILTER is one of \f[CR]test\f[R], \f[CR]match\f[R], or
\f[CR]capture\f[R], as described below.
.PP
Since REGEX must evaluate to a JSON string, some characters that are
needed to form a regular expression must be escaped.
For example, the regular expression \f[CR]\[rs]s\f[R] signifying a
whitespace character would be written as
\f[CR]\[dq]\[rs]\[rs]s\[dq]\f[R].

\f[CR]tostring\f[R] should be a jq string or a stream of such strings,
each of which may contain references to named captures.

.SS I/O functions
At this time jq has minimal support for I/O, mostly in the form of
control over when inputs are read.
Two builtins functions are provided for this, \f[CR]input\f[R] and
\f[CR]inputs\f[R], that read from the same sources (e.g.,
\f[CR]stdin\f[R], files named on the command\-line) as jq itself.
These two builtins, and jq\[cq]s own reading actions, can be interleaved
with each other.
They are commonly used in combination with the null input option
\f[CR]\-n\f[R] to prevent one input from being read implicitly.
.PP
Two builtins provide minimal output capabilities, \f[CR]debug\f[R], and
\f[CR]stderr\f[R].
(Recall that a jq program\[cq]s output values are always output as JSON
texts on \f[CR]stdout\f[R].)
The \f[CR]debug\f[R] builtin can have application\-specific behavior,
such as for executables that use the libjq C API but aren\[cq]t the jq
executable itself.
The \f[CR]stderr\f[R] builtin outputs its input in raw mode to stder
with no additional decoration, not even a newline.
.PP
Most jq builtins are referentially transparent, and yield constant and
repeatable value streams when applied to constant inputs.
This is not true of I/O builtins.
.SS \f[CR]input\f[R], \f[CR]inputs\f[R]
The filter \f[CR]input\f[R] outputs one new input, and the filter
\f[CR]inputs\f[R] outputs all remaining inputs.
This is primarily useful for reductions over a program\[cq]s inputs.
.TP
\f[I]Note\f[R]
When using \f[CR]input\f[R] or \f[CR]inputs\f[R], it is often necessary
to invoke jq with the \f[CR]\-n\f[R] command\-line option to avoid
losing the first value in the input stream.
.IP
.EX
$ echo 1 2 3 4 | jq \[aq][., input]\[aq]
[1,2]
[3,4]
$ echo 1 2 3 | jq \-n \[aq]reduce inputs as $i (0; . + $i)\[aq]
6
.EE
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
When there is no more input value left, in jq, \f[CR]input\f[R] yields
an error, whereas in jaq, \f[CR]input\f[R] yields no output value,
i.e.\ \f[CR]empty\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]debug\f[R], \f[CR]debug(msgs)\f[R]
These two filters are like \f[CR].\f[R] but have as a side\-effect the
production of one or more messages on stderr.
.PP
The message produced by the \f[CR]debug\f[R] filter has the form
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]DEBUG:\[dq],<input\-value>]
.EE
.PP
where \f[CR]<input\-value>\f[R] is a compact rendition of the input
value.
This format may change in the future.
.PP
The \f[CR]debug(msgs)\f[R] filter is defined as
\f[CR](msgs | debug | empty), .\f[R] thus allowing great flexibility in
the content of the message, while also allowing multi\-line debugging
statements to be created.
.PP
For example, the expression:
.IP
.EX
1 as $x | 2 | debug(\[dq]Entering function foo with $x == \[rs]($x)\[dq], .) | (.+1)
.EE
.PP
would produce the value 3 but with the following two lines being written
to stderr:
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]DEBUG:\[dq],\[dq]Entering function foo with $x == 1\[dq]]
[\[dq]DEBUG:\[dq],2]
.EE
.SS \f[CR]stderr\f[R]
Prints its input in raw and compact mode to stderr with no additional
decoration, not even a newline.
.SS \f[CR]halt\f[R]
Stops the jq program with no further outputs.
jq will exit with exit status \f[CR]0\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]halt_error\f[R], \f[CR]halt_error(exit_code)\f[R]
Stops the jq program with no further outputs.
The input will be printed on \f[CR]stderr\f[R] as raw output (i.e.,
strings will not have double quotes) with no decoration, not even a
newline.
.PP
The given \f[CR]exit_code\f[R] (defaulting to \f[CR]5\f[R]) will be
jq\[cq]s exit status.
.PP
For example,
\f[CR]\[dq]Error: something went wrong\[rs]n\[dq]|halt_error(1)\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]input_filename\f[R]
Returns the name of the file whose input is currently being filtered.
Note that this will not work well unless jq is running in a UTF\-8
locale.
.TP
\f[I]Compatibility\f[R]
jaq does not provide this function.

set when the jq program started.

environment.

.SS Streaming functions
With the \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R] option jq can parse input texts in a
streaming fashion, allowing jq programs to start processing large JSON
texts immediately rather than after the parse completes.
If you have a single JSON text that is 1GB in size, streaming it will
allow you to process it much more quickly.
.PP
However, streaming isn\[cq]t easy to deal with as the jq program will
have \f[CR][<path>, <leaf\-value>]\f[R] (and a few other forms) as
inputs.
.PP
Several builtins are provided to make handling streams easier.
.PP
The examples below use the streamed form of \f[CR][0,[1]]\f[R], which is
\f[CR][[0],0],[[1,0],1],[[1,0]],[[1]]\f[R].
.PP
Streaming forms include \f[CR][<path>, <leaf\-value>]\f[R] (to indicate
any scalar value, empty array, or empty object), and \f[CR][<path>]\f[R]
(to indicate the end of an array or object).
Future versions of jq run with \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R] and
\f[CR]\-\-seq\f[R] may output additional forms such as
\f[CR][\[dq]error message\[dq]]\f[R] when an input text fails to parse.
.TP

.SH NAME
jq \[en] Command\-line JSON processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CR]jq\f[R] [\&...]
\ [\&...]
.PP
\f[CR]jq\f[R] can transform JSON in various ways, by selecting,
iterating, reducing and otherwise mangling JSON documents.
For instance, running the command
\f[CR]jq \[aq]map(.price) | add\[aq]\f[R] will take an array of JSON
objects as input and return the sum of their \[lq]price\[rq] fields.
.PP
\f[CR]jq\f[R] can accept text input as well, but by default,
\f[CR]jq\f[R] reads a stream of JSON entities (including numbers and
other literals) from \f[CR]stdin\f[R].
Whitespace is only needed to separate entities such as 1 and 2, and true
and false.
One or more  may be specified, in which case \f[CR]jq\f[R] will read
input from those instead.
.PP
The  are described in the INVOKING JQ section; they mostly concern input
and output formatting.
The  is written in the jq language and specifies how to transform the
input file or document.
.SH FILTERS
A jq program is a \[lq]filter\[rq]: it takes an input, and produces an
output.
There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a particular field of
an object, or converting a number to a string, or various other standard
tasks.
.PP
Filters can be combined in various ways \- you can pipe the output of
one filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter into
an array.
.PP
Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there\[cq]s one that
produces all the elements of its input array.
Piping that filter into a second runs the second filter for each element
of the array.
Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration in other
languages are just done by gluing filters together in jq.
.PP
It\[cq]s important to remember that every filter has an input and an
output.
Even literals like \[lq]hello\[rq] or 42 are filters \- they take an
input but always produce the same literal as output.
Operations that combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the
same input to both and combine the results.
So, you can implement an averaging filter as \f[CR]add / length\f[R] \-
feeding the input array both to the \f[CR]add\f[R] filter and the
\f[CR]length\f[R] filter and then performing the division.
.PP
But that\[cq]s getting ahead of ourselves.
:) Let\[cq]s start with something simpler:
.SH INVOKING JQ
jq filters run on a stream of JSON data.
The input to jq is parsed as a sequence of whitespace\-separated JSON
values which are passed through the provided filter one at a time.
The output(s) of the filter are written to standard output, as a
sequence of newline\-separated JSON data.
.PP
The simplest and most common filter (or jq program) is \f[CR].\f[R],
which is the identity operator, copying the inputs of the jq processor
to the output stream.
Because the default behavior of the jq processor is to read JSON texts
from the input stream, and to pretty\-print outputs, the \f[CR].\f[R]
program\[cq]s main use is to validate and pretty\-print the inputs.
The jq programming language is quite rich and allows for much more than
just validation and pretty\-printing.
.PP
Note: it is important to mind the shell\[cq]s quoting rules.
As a general rule it\[cq]s best to always quote (with single\-quote
characters on Unix shells) the jq program, as too many characters with
special meaning to jq are also shell meta\-characters.
For example, \f[CR]jq \[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R] will fail on most Unix shells
because that will be the same as \f[CR]jq foo\f[R], which will generally
fail because \f[CR]foo is not defined\f[R].
When using the Windows command shell (cmd.exe) it\[cq]s best to use
double quotes around your jq program when given on the command\-line
(instead of the \f[CR]\-f program\-file\f[R] option), but then
double\-quotes in the jq program need backslash escaping.
When using the Powershell (\f[CR]powershell.exe\f[R]) or the Powershell
Core (\f[CR]pwsh\f[R]/\f[CR]pwsh.exe\f[R]), use single\-quote characters
around the jq program and backslash\-escaped double\-quotes
(\f[CR]\[rs]\[dq]\f[R]) inside the jq program.

.PP
Note: jq allows user\-defined functions, but every jq program must have
a top\-level expression.
.PP
You can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output using some
command\-line options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-null\-input\f[R] / \f[CR]\-n\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Don\[cq]t read any input at all.
Instead, the filter is run once using \f[CR]null\f[R] as the input.
This is useful when using jq as a simple calculator or to construct JSON
data from scratch.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-raw\-input\f[R] / \f[CR]\-R\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Don\[cq]t parse the input as JSON.
Instead, each line of text is passed to the filter as a string.
If combined with \f[CR]\-\-slurp\f[R], then the entire input is passed
to the filter as a single long string.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-slurp\f[R] / \f[CR]\-s\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the input, read
the entire input stream into a large array and run the filter just once.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-compact\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-c\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
By default, jq pretty\-prints JSON output.
Using this option will result in more compact output by instead putting
each JSON object on a single line.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-raw\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-r\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
With this option, if the filter\[cq]s result is a string then it will be
written directly to standard output rather than being formatted as a
JSON string with quotes.
This can be useful for making jq filters talk to non\-JSON\-based
systems.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-raw\-output0\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Like \f[CR]\-r\f[R] but jq will print NUL instead of newline after each
output.
This can be useful when the values being output can contain newlines.
When the output value contains NUL, jq exits with non\-zero code.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-join\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-j\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Like \f[CR]\-r\f[R] but jq won\[cq]t print a newline after each output.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-ascii\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-a\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
jq usually outputs non\-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF\-8, even if the
input specified them as escape sequences (like \[lq]3bc\[rq]).
Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII output with
every non\-ASCII character replaced with the equivalent escape sequence.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-sort\-keys\f[R] / \f[CR]\-S\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Output the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-color\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-C\f[R] and
\f[CR]\-\-monochrome\-output\f[R] / \f[CR]\-M\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a terminal.
You can force it to produce color even if writing to a pipe or a file
using \f[CR]\-C\f[R], and disable color with \f[CR]\-M\f[R].
When the \f[CR]NO_COLOR\f[R] environment variable is not empty, jq
disables colored output by default, but you can enable it by
\f[CR]\-C\f[R].
.PP
Colors can be configured with the \f[CR]JQ_COLORS\f[R] environment
variable (see below).
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-tab\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Use a tab for each indentation level instead of two spaces.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-indent n\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Use the given number of spaces (no more than 7) for indentation.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-unbuffered\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Flush the output after each JSON object is printed (useful if you\[cq]re
piping a slow data source into jq and piping jq\[cq]s output elsewhere).
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Parse the input in streaming fashion, outputting arrays of path and leaf
values (scalars and empty arrays or empty objects).
For example, \f[CR]\[dq]a\[dq]\f[R] becomes \f[CR][[],\[dq]a\[dq]]\f[R],
and \f[CR][[],\[dq]a\[dq],[\[dq]b\[dq]]]\f[R] becomes
\f[CR][[0],[]]\f[R], \f[CR][[1],\[dq]a\[dq]]\f[R], and
\f[CR][[2,0],\[dq]b\[dq]]\f[R].
.PP
This is useful for processing very large inputs.
Use this in conjunction with filtering and the \f[CR]reduce\f[R] and
\f[CR]foreach\f[R] syntax to reduce large inputs incrementally.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-stream\-errors\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Like \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R], but invalid JSON inputs yield array values
where the first element is the error and the second is a path.
For example, \f[CR][\[dq]a\[dq],n]\f[R] produces
\f[CR][\[dq]Invalid literal at line 1, column 7\[dq],[1]]\f[R].
.PP
Implies \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R].
Invalid JSON inputs produce no error values when \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R]
without \f[CR]\-\-stream\-errors\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-seq\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Use the \f[CR]application/json\-seq\f[R] MIME type scheme for separating
JSON texts in jq\[cq]s input and output.
This means that an ASCII RS (record separator) character is printed
before each value on output and an ASCII LF (line feed) is printed after
every output.
Input JSON texts that fail to parse are ignored (but warned about),
discarding all subsequent input until the next RS.
This mode also parses the output of jq without the \f[CR]\-\-seq\f[R]
option.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-f filename\f[R] / \f[CR]\-\-from\-file filename\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Read filter from the file rather than from a command line, like
awk\[cq]s \-f option.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-L directory\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Prepend \f[CR]directory\f[R] to the search list for modules.
If this option is used then no builtin search list is used.
See the section on modules below.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-arg name value\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
This option passes a value to the jq program as a predefined variable.
If you run jq with \f[CR]\-\-arg foo bar\f[R], then \f[CR]$foo\f[R] is
available in the program and has the value \f[CR]\[dq]bar\[dq]\f[R].
Note that \f[CR]value\f[R] will be treated as a string, so
\f[CR]\-\-arg foo 123\f[R] will bind \f[CR]$foo\f[R] to
\f[CR]\[dq]123\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
Named arguments are also available to the jq program as
\f[CR]$ARGS.named\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-argjson name JSON\-text\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
This option passes a JSON\-encoded value to the jq program as a
predefined variable.
If you run jq with \f[CR]\-\-argjson foo 123\f[R], then \f[CR]$foo\f[R]
is available in the program and has the value \f[CR]123\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-slurpfile variable\-name filename\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
This option reads all the JSON texts in the named file and binds an
array of the parsed JSON values to the given global variable.
If you run jq with \f[CR]\-\-slurpfile foo bar\f[R], then
\f[CR]$foo\f[R] is available in the program and has an array whose
elements correspond to the texts in the file named \f[CR]bar\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-rawfile variable\-name filename\f[R]:

If you run jq with \f[CR]\-\-rawfile foo bar\f[R], then \f[CR]$foo\f[R]
is available in the program and has a string whose contents are to the
texts in the file named \f[CR]bar\f[R].

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-exit\-status\f[R] / \f[CR]\-e\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
Sets the exit status of jq to 0 if the last output value was neither
\f[CR]false\f[R] nor \f[CR]null\f[R], 1 if the last output value was
either \f[CR]false\f[R] or \f[CR]null\f[R], or 4 if no valid result was
ever produced.
Normally jq exits with 2 if there was any usage problem or system error,
3 if there was a jq program compile error, or 0 if the jq program ran.

Another way to set the exit status is with the \f[CR]halt_error\f[R]
builtin function.

Runs the tests in the given file or standard input.
This must be the last option given and does not honor all preceding

The input consists of comment lines, empty lines, and program lines
followed by one input line, as many lines of output as are expected (one

.RE
.SH BASIC FILTERS
.SS Identity: \f[CR].\f[R]
The absolute simplest filter is \f[CR].\f[R] .
This filter takes its input and produces the same value as output.
That is, this is the identity operator.
.PP
Since jq by default pretty\-prints all output, a trivial program
consisting of nothing but \f[CR].\f[R] can be used to format JSON output
from, say, \f[CR]curl\f[R].
.PP
Although the identity filter never modifies the value of its input, jq
processing can sometimes make it appear as though it does.
For example, using the current implementation of jq, we would see that
the expression:
.IP
.EX
1E1234567890 | .
.EE
.PP
produces \f[CR]1.7976931348623157e+308\f[R] on at least one platform.
This is because, in the process of parsing the number, this particular
version of jq has converted it to an IEEE754 double\-precision
representation, losing precision.
.PP
The way in which jq handles numbers has changed over time and further
changes are likely within the parameters set by the relevant JSON
standards.
Moreover, build configuration options can alter how jq processes
numbers.
.PP
The following remarks are therefore offered with the understanding that
they are intended to be descriptive of the current version of jq and
should not be interpreted as being prescriptive:
.IP "(1)" 4
Any arithmetic operation on a number that has not already been converted
to an IEEE754 double precision representation will trigger a conversion
to the IEEE754 representation.
.IP "(2)" 4
jq will attempt to maintain the original decimal precision of number
literals (if the \f[CR]\-\-disable\-decnum\f[R] build configuration
option was not used), but in expressions such \f[CR]1E1234567890\f[R],
precision will be lost if the exponent is too large.
.IP "(3)" 4
In jq programs, a leading minus sign will trigger the conversion of the
number to an IEEE754 representation.
.IP "(4)" 4
Comparisons are carried out using the untruncated big decimal
representation of numbers if available, as illustrated in one of the
following examples.
.PP
The examples below use the builtin function \f[CR]have_decnum\f[R] in
order to demonstrate the expected effects of using / not using the
\f[CR]\-\-disable\-decnum\f[R] build configuration option, and also to
allow automated tests derived from these examples to pass regardless of
whether that option is used.

.SS Object Identifier\-Index: \f[CR].foo\f[R], \f[CR].foo.bar\f[R]
The simplest \f[I]useful\f[R] filter has the form \f[CR].foo\f[R].
When given a JSON object (aka dictionary or hash) as input,
\f[CR].foo\f[R] produces the value at the key \[lq]foo\[rq] if the key
is present, or null otherwise.
.PP
A filter of the form \f[CR].foo.bar\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR].foo | .bar\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR].foo\f[R] syntax only works for simple, identifier\-like keys,
that is, keys that are all made of alphanumeric characters and
underscore, and which do not start with a digit.
.PP
If the key contains special characters or starts with a digit, you need
to surround it with double quotes like this: \f[CR].\[dq]foo$\[dq]\f[R],
or else \f[CR].[\[dq]foo$\[dq]]\f[R].
.PP
For example \f[CR].[\[dq]foo::bar\[dq]]\f[R] and
\f[CR].[\[dq]foo.bar\[dq]]\f[R] work while \f[CR].foo::bar\f[R] does
not.

.SS Array/Object Value Iterator: \f[CR].[]\f[R]
If you use the \f[CR].[index]\f[R] syntax, but omit the index entirely,
it will return \f[I]all\f[R] of the elements of an array.
Running \f[CR].[]\f[R] with the input \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] will produce
the numbers as three separate results, rather than as a single array.
A filter of the form \f[CR].foo[]\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR].foo | .[]\f[R].
.PP
You can also use this on an object, and it will return all the values of
the object.

Note that the iterator operator is a generator of values.

If two filters are separated by a comma, then the same input will be fed
into both and the two filters\[cq] output value streams will be
concatenated in order: first, all of the outputs produced by the left
expression, and then all of the outputs produced by the right.
For instance, filter \f[CR].foo, .bar\f[R], produces both the
\[lq]foo\[rq] fields and \[lq]bar\[rq] fields as separate outputs.

.SS Pipe: \f[CR]|\f[R]
The | operator combines two filters by feeding the output(s) of the one
on the left into the input of the one on the right.
It\[cq]s similar to the Unix shell\[cq]s pipe, if you\[cq]re used to
that.
.PP
If the one on the left produces multiple results, the one on the right
will be run for each of those results.
So, the expression \f[CR].[] | .foo\f[R] retrieves the \[lq]foo\[rq]
field of each element of the input array.
This is a cartesian product, which can be surprising.
.PP
Note that \f[CR].a.b.c\f[R] is the same as \f[CR].a | .b | .c\f[R].
.PP
Note too that \f[CR].\f[R] is the input value at the particular stage in
a \[lq]pipeline\[rq], specifically: where the \f[CR].\f[R] expression
appears.
Thus \f[CR].a | . | .b\f[R] is the same as \f[CR].a.b\f[R], as the
\f[CR].\f[R] in the middle refers to whatever value \f[CR].a\f[R]
produced.

.SH TYPES AND VALUES
jq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON \- numbers, strings,
booleans, arrays, objects (which in JSON\-speak are hashes with only
string keys), and \[lq]null\[rq].
.PP
Booleans, null, strings and numbers are written the same way as in JSON.
Just like everything else in jq, these simple values take an input and
produce an output \- \f[CR]42\f[R] is a valid jq expression that takes
an input, ignores it, and returns 42 instead.
.PP
Numbers in jq are internally represented by their IEEE754 double
precision approximation.
Any arithmetic operation with numbers, whether they are literals or
results of previous filters, will produce a double precision floating
point result.
.PP
However, when parsing a literal jq will store the original literal
string.
If no mutation is applied to this value then it will make to the output
in its original form, even if conversion to double would result in a
loss.
.SS Array construction: \f[CR][]\f[R]
As in JSON, \f[CR][]\f[R] is used to construct arrays, as in
\f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R].
The elements of the arrays can be any jq expression, including a
pipeline.
All of the results produced by all of the expressions are collected into
one big array.
You can use it to construct an array out of a known quantity of values
(as in \f[CR][.foo, .bar, .baz]\f[R]) or to \[lq]collect\[rq] all the
results of a filter into an array (as in \f[CR][.items[].name]\f[R])
.PP
Once you understand the \[lq],\[rq] operator, you can look at jq\[cq]s
array syntax in a different light: the expression \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] is
not using a built\-in syntax for comma\-separated arrays, but is instead
applying the \f[CR][]\f[R] operator (collect results) to the expression
1,2,3 (which produces three different results).
.PP
If you have a filter \f[CR]X\f[R] that produces four results, then the
expression \f[CR][X]\f[R] will produce a single result, an array of four
elements.

.SS Object Construction: \f[CR]{}\f[R]
Like JSON, \f[CR]{}\f[R] is for constructing objects (aka dictionaries
or hashes), as in: \f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]: 42, \[dq]b\[dq]: 17}\f[R].
.PP
If the keys are \[lq]identifier\-like\[rq], then the quotes can be left
off, as in \f[CR]{a:42, b:17}\f[R].
Variable references as key expressions use the value of the variable as
the key.
Key expressions other than constant literals, identifiers, or variable
references, need to be parenthesized, e.g.,
\f[CR]{(\[dq]a\[dq]+\[dq]b\[dq]):59}\f[R].
.PP
The value can be any expression (although you may need to wrap it in
parentheses if, for example, it contains colons), which gets applied to
the {} expression\[cq]s input (remember, all filters have an input and
an output).
.IP
.EX
{foo: .bar}
.EE
.PP

JSON object \f[CR]{\[dq]bar\[dq]:42, \[dq]baz\[dq]:43}\f[R] as its
input.
You can use this to select particular fields of an object: if the input
is an object with \[lq]user\[rq], \[lq]title\[rq], \[lq]id\[rq], and
\[lq]content\[rq] fields and you just want \[lq]user\[rq] and
\[lq]title\[rq], you can write
.IP
.EX
{user: .user, title: .title}
.EE
.PP
Because that is so common, there\[cq]s a shortcut syntax for it:
\f[CR]{user, title}\f[R].
.PP
If one of the expressions produces multiple results, multiple
dictionaries will be produced.
If the input\[cq]s
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]user\[dq]:\[dq]stedolan\[dq],\[dq]titles\[dq]:[\[dq]JQ Primer\[dq], \[dq]More JQ\[dq]]}

.PP
then the expression
.IP
.EX
{user, title: .titles[]}
.EE

will produce two outputs:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]user\[dq]:\[dq]stedolan\[dq], \[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]JQ Primer\[dq]}
{\[dq]user\[dq]:\[dq]stedolan\[dq], \[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]More JQ\[dq]}
.EE
.PP
Putting parentheses around the key means it will be evaluated as an
expression.
With the same input as above,
.IP

{(.user): .titles}
.EE
.PP
produces
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]stedolan\[dq]: [\[dq]JQ Primer\[dq], \[dq]More JQ\[dq]]}

Note that \f[CR]..a\f[R] does not work; use \f[CR].. | .a\f[R] instead.

.SH BUILTIN OPERATORS AND FUNCTIONS
Some jq operators (for instance, \f[CR]+\f[R]) do different things
depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers, etc.).
However, jq never does implicit type conversions.
If you try to add a string to an object you\[cq]ll get an error message
and no result.
.PP
Please note that all numbers are converted to IEEE754 double precision
floating point representation.
Arithmetic and logical operators are working with these converted
doubles.
Results of all such operations are also limited to the double precision.
.PP
The only exception to this behaviour of number is a snapshot of original
number literal.
When a number which originally was provided as a literal is never
mutated until the end of the program then it is printed to the output in
its original literal form.
This also includes cases when the original literal would be truncated
when converted to the IEEE754 double precision floating point number.
.SS Addition: \f[CR]+\f[R]
The operator \f[CR]+\f[R] takes two filters, applies them both to the
same input, and adds the results together.
What \[lq]adding\[rq] means depends on the types involved:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Numbers\f[R] are added by normal arithmetic.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Arrays\f[R] are added by being concatenated into a larger array.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Strings\f[R] are added by being joined into a larger string.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Objects\f[R] are added by merging, that is, inserting all the
key\-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object.
If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object on the
right of the \f[CR]+\f[R] wins.
(For recursive merge use the \f[CR]*\f[R] operator.)
.PP
\f[CR]null\f[R] can be added to any value, and returns the other value
unchanged.

.SS Multiplication, division, modulo: \f[CR]*\f[R], \f[CR]/\f[R], \f[CR]%\f[R]
These infix operators behave as expected when given two numbers.
Division by zero raises an error.
\f[CR]x % y\f[R] computes x modulo y.
.PP
Multiplying a string by a number produces the concatenation of that
string that many times.
\f[CR]\[dq]x\[dq] * 0\f[R] produces \f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
Dividing a string by another splits the first using the second as
separators.

Multiplying two objects will merge them recursively: this works like
addition but if both objects contain a value for the same key, and the
values are objects, the two are merged with the same strategy.

For any filter \f[CR]f\f[R], \f[CR]map(f)\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] apply \f[CR]f\f[R] to each of the values in the
input array or object, that is, to the values of \f[CR].[]\f[R].
.PP
In the absence of errors, \f[CR]map(f)\f[R] always outputs an array
whereas \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] outputs an array if given an array, or
an object if given an object.
.PP
When the input to \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] is an object, the output
object has the same keys as the input object except for those keys whose
values when piped to \f[CR]f\f[R] produce no values at all.
.PP
The key difference between \f[CR]map(f)\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] is that the former simply forms an array from
all the values of \f[CR]($x|f)\f[R] for each value, \f[CR]$x\f[R], in
the input array or object, but \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] only uses
\f[CR]first($x|f)\f[R].
.PP
Specifically, for object inputs, \f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] constructs the
output object by examining in turn the value of
\f[CR]first(.[$k]|f)\f[R] for each key, \f[CR]$k\f[R], of the input.
If this expression produces no values, then the corresponding key will
be dropped; otherwise, the output object will have that value at the
key, \f[CR]$k\f[R].
.PP
Here are some examples to clarify the behavior of \f[CR]map\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values\f[R] when applied to arrays.
These examples assume the input is \f[CR][1]\f[R] in all cases:
.IP

map_values(., .)  #=>  [1]
map_values(empty) #=>  []
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]map(f)\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR][.[] | f]\f[R] and
\f[CR]map_values(f)\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR].[] |= f\f[R].

In fact, these are their implementations.

.SS \f[CR]path(path_expression)\f[R]
Outputs array representations of the given path expression in
\f[CR].\f[R].
The outputs are arrays of strings (object keys) and/or numbers (array
indices).
.PP
Path expressions are jq expressions like \f[CR].a\f[R], but also
\f[CR].[]\f[R].
There are two types of path expressions: ones that can match exactly,
and ones that cannot.
For example, \f[CR].a.b.c\f[R] is an exact match path expression, while
\f[CR].a[].b\f[R] is not.
.PP
\f[CR]path(exact_path_expression)\f[R] will produce the array
representation of the path expression even if it does not exist in
\f[CR].\f[R], if \f[CR].\f[R] is \f[CR]null\f[R] or an array or an
object.
.PP
\f[CR]path(pattern)\f[R] will produce array representations of the paths
matching \f[CR]pattern\f[R] if the paths exist in \f[CR].\f[R].
.PP
Note that the path expressions are not different from normal
expressions.
The expression \f[CR]path(..|select(type==\[dq]boolean\[dq]))\f[R]
outputs all the paths to boolean values in \f[CR].\f[R], and only those
paths.

.SS \f[CR]recurse(f)\f[R], \f[CR]recurse\f[R], \f[CR]recurse(f; condition)\f[R]
The \f[CR]recurse(f)\f[R] function allows you to search through a
recursive structure, and extract interesting data from all levels.
Suppose your input represents a filesystem:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]/\[dq], \[dq]children\[dq]: [

.PP
Now suppose you want to extract all of the filenames present.
You need to retrieve \f[CR].name\f[R], \f[CR].children[].name\f[R],
\f[CR].children[].children[].name\f[R], and so on.
You can do this with:
.IP

.EE
.PP
When called without an argument, \f[CR]recurse\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR]recurse(.[]?)\f[R].
.PP
\f[CR]recurse(f)\f[R] is identical to \f[CR]recurse(f; true)\f[R] and
can be used without concerns about recursion depth.
.PP
\f[CR]recurse(f; condition)\f[R] is a generator which begins by emitting
\&.
and then emits in turn .|f, .|f|f, .|f|f|f, \&...
so long as the computed value satisfies the condition.
For example, to generate all the integers, at least in principle, one
could write \f[CR]recurse(.+1; true)\f[R].

The recursive calls in \f[CR]recurse\f[R] will not consume additional
memory whenever \f[CR]f\f[R] produces at most a single output for each

.SS \f[CR]walk(f)\f[R]
The \f[CR]walk(f)\f[R] function applies f recursively to every component
of the input entity.
When an array is encountered, f is first applied to its elements and
then to the array itself; when an object is encountered, f is first
applied to all the values and then to the object.
In practice, f will usually test the type of its input, as illustrated
in the following examples.
The first example highlights the usefulness of processing the elements
of an array of arrays before processing the array itself.
The second example shows how all the keys of all the objects within the
input can be considered for alteration.

.SS Format strings and escaping
The \f[CR]\[at]foo\f[R] syntax is used to format and escape strings,
which is useful for building URLs, documents in a language like HTML or
XML, and so forth.
\f[CR]\[at]foo\f[R] can be used as a filter on its own, the possible
escapings are:

Input characters line\-feed (ascii \f[CR]0x0a\f[R]), carriage\-return
(ascii \f[CR]0x0d\f[R]), tab (ascii \f[CR]0x09\f[R]) and backslash
(ascii \f[CR]0x5c\f[R]) will be output as escape sequences
\f[CR]\[rs]n\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]r\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]t\f[R],
\f[CR]\[rs]\[rs]\f[R] respectively.

.RE
.PP
This syntax can be combined with string interpolation in a useful way.
You can follow a \f[CR]\[at]foo\f[R] token with a string literal.
The contents of the string literal will \f[I]not\f[R] be escaped.
However, all interpolations made inside that string literal will be
escaped.
For instance,
.IP
.EX

\f[CR]{\[dq]search\[dq]:\[dq]what is jq?\[dq]}\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\[dq]https://www.google.com/search?q=what%20is%20jq%3F\[dq]

Note that the slashes, question mark, etc.
in the URL are not escaped, as they were part of the string literal.

.SS Dates
jq provides some basic date handling functionality, with some
high\-level and low\-level builtins.
In all cases these builtins deal exclusively with time in UTC.
.PP
The \f[CR]fromdateiso8601\f[R] builtin parses datetimes in the ISO 8601
format to a number of seconds since the Unix epoch
(1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z).
The \f[CR]todateiso8601\f[R] builtin does the inverse.
.PP
The \f[CR]fromdate\f[R] builtin parses datetime strings.
Currently \f[CR]fromdate\f[R] only supports ISO 8601 datetime strings,
but in the future it will attempt to parse datetime strings in more
formats.
.PP
The \f[CR]todate\f[R] builtin is an alias for \f[CR]todateiso8601\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]now\f[R] builtin outputs the current time, in seconds since
the Unix epoch.
.PP
Low\-level jq interfaces to the C\-library time functions are also
provided: \f[CR]strptime\f[R], \f[CR]strftime\f[R],
\f[CR]strflocaltime\f[R], \f[CR]mktime\f[R], \f[CR]gmtime\f[R], and
\f[CR]localtime\f[R].
Refer to your host operating system\[cq]s documentation for the format
strings used by \f[CR]strptime\f[R] and \f[CR]strftime\f[R].
Note: these are not necessarily stable interfaces in jq, particularly as
to their localization functionality.
.PP
The \f[CR]gmtime\f[R] builtin consumes a number of seconds since the
Unix epoch and outputs a \[lq]broken down time\[rq] representation of
Greenwich Mean Time as an array of numbers representing (in this order):
the year, the month (zero\-based), the day of the month (one\-based),
the hour of the day, the minute of the hour, the second of the minute,
the day of the week, and the day of the year \[en] all one\-based unless
otherwise stated.
The day of the week number may be wrong on some systems for dates before
March 1st 1900, or after December 31 2099.
.PP
The \f[CR]localtime\f[R] builtin works like the \f[CR]gmtime\f[R]
builtin, but using the local timezone setting.
.PP
The \f[CR]mktime\f[R] builtin consumes \[lq]broken down time\[rq]
representations of time output by \f[CR]gmtime\f[R] and
\f[CR]strptime\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]strptime(fmt)\f[R] builtin parses input strings matching the
\f[CR]fmt\f[R] argument.
The output is in the \[lq]broken down time\[rq] representation consumed
by \f[CR]mktime\f[R] and output by \f[CR]gmtime\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]strftime(fmt)\f[R] builtin formats a time (GMT) with the given
format.
The \f[CR]strflocaltime\f[R] does the same, but using the local timezone
setting.
.PP
The format strings for \f[CR]strptime\f[R] and \f[CR]strftime\f[R] are
described in typical C library documentation.
The format string for ISO 8601 datetime is
\f[CR]\[dq]%Y\-%m\-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
jq may not support some or all of this date functionality on some
systems.
In particular, the \f[CR]%u\f[R] and \f[CR]%j\f[R] specifiers for
\f[CR]strptime(fmt)\f[R] are not supported on macOS.

.SS SQL\-Style Operators

.IP \[bu] 2

\f[CR]JOIN($idx; stream; idx_expr; join_expr)\f[R]:
.RS 2

to each value from the given stream.
An array of the value in the stream and the corresponding value from the
index is fed to the given join expression to produce each result.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]JOIN($idx; stream; idx_expr)\f[R]:

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]JOIN($idx; idx_expr)\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP

the given index expression to \f[CR].\f[R] to compute the index key.
The join operation is as described above.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]IN(s)\f[R]:
.RS 2

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]IN(source; s)\f[R]:
.RS 2
.PP
This builtin outputs \f[CR]true\f[R] if any value in the source stream
appears in the second stream, otherwise it outputs \f[CR]false\f[R].
.RE
.SS \f[CR]builtins\f[R]
Returns a list of all builtin functions in the format
\f[CR]name/arity\f[R].
Since functions with the same name but different arities are considered
separate functions, \f[CR]all/0\f[R], \f[CR]all/1\f[R], and
\f[CR]all/2\f[R] would all be present in the list.
.SH CONDITIONALS AND COMPARISONS
.SS \f[CR]==\f[R], \f[CR]!=\f[R]
The expression `a == b' will produce `true' if the results of evaluating
a and b are equal (that is, if they represent equivalent JSON values)
and `false' otherwise.
In particular, strings are never considered equal to numbers.
In checking for the equality of JSON objects, the ordering of keys is
irrelevant.
If you\[cq]re coming from JavaScript, please note that jq\[cq]s
\f[CR]==\f[R] is like JavaScript\[cq]s \f[CR]===\f[R], the \[lq]strict
equality\[rq] operator.

!= is \[lq]not equal\[rq], and `a != b' returns the opposite value of `a

as \f[CR]C\f[R] otherwise.
.PP
\f[CR]if A then B end\f[R] is the same as
\f[CR]if A then B else .  end\f[R].
That is, the \f[CR]else\f[R] branch is optional, and if absent is the
same as \f[CR].\f[R].
This also applies to \f[CR]elif\f[R] with absent ending \f[CR]else\f[R]
branch.
.PP
Checking for false or null is a simpler notion of \[lq]truthiness\[rq]
than is found in JavaScript or Python, but it means that you\[cq]ll
sometimes have to be more explicit about the condition you want.
You can\[cq]t test whether, e.g.\ a string is empty using
\f[CR]if .name then A else B end\f[R]; you\[cq]ll need something like
\f[CR]if .name == \[dq]\[dq] then A else B end\f[R] instead.
.PP
If the condition \f[CR]A\f[R] produces multiple results, then
\f[CR]B\f[R] is evaluated once for each result that is not false or
null, and \f[CR]C\f[R] is evaluated once for each false or null.

.SS \f[CR]and\f[R], \f[CR]or\f[R], \f[CR]not\f[R]
jq supports the normal Boolean operators \f[CR]and\f[R], \f[CR]or\f[R],
\f[CR]not\f[R].
They have the same standard of truth as if expressions \-
\f[CR]false\f[R] and \f[CR]null\f[R] are considered \[lq]false
values\[rq], and anything else is a \[lq]true value\[rq].
.PP
If an operand of one of these operators produces multiple results, the
operator itself will produce a result for each input.
.PP
\f[CR]not\f[R] is in fact a builtin function rather than an operator, so
it is called as a filter to which things can be piped rather than with
special syntax, as in \f[CR].foo and .bar | not\f[R].
.PP
These three only produce the values \f[CR]true\f[R] and
\f[CR]false\f[R], and so are only useful for genuine Boolean operations,
rather than the common Perl/Python/Ruby idiom of
\[lq]value_that_may_be_null or default\[rq].
If you want to use this form of \[lq]or\[rq], picking between two values
rather than evaluating a condition, see the \f[CR]//\f[R] operator
below.

.SS Alternative operator: \f[CR]//\f[R]
The \f[CR]//\f[R] operator produces all the values of its left\-hand
side that are neither \f[CR]false\f[R] nor \f[CR]null\f[R].
If the left\-hand side produces no values other than \f[CR]false\f[R] or
\f[CR]null\f[R], then \f[CR]//\f[R] produces all the values of its
right\-hand side.
.PP
A filter of the form \f[CR]a // b\f[R] produces all the results of
\f[CR]a\f[R] that are not \f[CR]false\f[R] or \f[CR]null\f[R].
If \f[CR]a\f[R] produces no results, or no results other than
\f[CR]false\f[R] or \f[CR]null\f[R], then \f[CR]a // b\f[R] produces the
results of \f[CR]b\f[R].
.PP
This is useful for providing defaults: \f[CR].foo // 1\f[R] will
evaluate to \f[CR]1\f[R] if there\[cq]s no \f[CR].foo\f[R] element in
the input.
It\[cq]s similar to how \f[CR]or\f[R] is sometimes used in Python
(jq\[cq]s \f[CR]or\f[R] operator is reserved for strictly Boolean
operations).
.PP
Note: \f[CR]some_generator // defaults_here\f[R] is not the same as
\f[CR]some_generator | . // defaults_here\f[R].
The latter will produce default values for all non\-\f[CR]false\f[R],
non\-\f[CR]null\f[R] values of the left\-hand side, while the former
will not.
Precedence rules can make this confusing.
For example, in \f[CR]false, 1 // 2\f[R] the left\-hand side of
\f[CR]//\f[R] is \f[CR]1\f[R], not \f[CR]false, 1\f[R] \[en]
\f[CR]false, 1 // 2\f[R] parses the same way as
\f[CR]false, (1 // 2)\f[R].
In \f[CR](false, null, 1) | . // 42\f[R] the left\-hand side of
\f[CR]//\f[R] is \f[CR].\f[R], which always produces just one value,
while in \f[CR](false, null, 1) // 42\f[R] the left\-hand side is a
generator of three values, and since it produces a value other
\f[CR]false\f[R] and \f[CR]null\f[R], the default \f[CR]42\f[R] is not
produced.

Oniguruma regular expression library
.UE \c
, as do PHP, TextMate, Sublime Text, etc, so the description here will
focus on jq specifics.
.PP
Oniguruma supports several flavors of regular expression, so it is
important to know that jq uses the \c
.UR https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/blob/master/doc/SYNTAX.md
\[lq]Perl NG\[rq] (Perl with named groups)
.UE \c
\ flavor.

The jq regex filters are defined so that they can be used using one of
these patterns:
.IP
.EX

STRING | FILTER([REGEX])
STRING | FILTER([REGEX, FLAGS])
.EE
.PP
where:
.IP \[bu] 2
STRING, REGEX, and FLAGS are jq strings and subject to jq string
interpolation;
.IP \[bu] 2
REGEX, after string interpolation, should be a valid regular expression;
.IP \[bu] 2
FILTER is one of \f[CR]test\f[R], \f[CR]match\f[R], or
\f[CR]capture\f[R], as described below.
.PP
Since REGEX must evaluate to a JSON string, some characters that are
needed to form a regular expression must be escaped.
For example, the regular expression \f[CR]\[rs]s\f[R] signifying a
whitespace character would be written as
\f[CR]\[dq]\[rs]\[rs]s\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
FLAGS is a string consisting of one of more of the supported flags:

\f[CR]g\f[R] \- Global search (find all matches, not just the first)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]i\f[R] \- Case insensitive search
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]m\f[R] \- Multi line mode (\f[CR].\f[R] will match newlines)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]n\f[R] \- Ignore empty matches
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]p\f[R] \- Both s and m modes are enabled
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]s\f[R] \- Single line mode (\f[CR]\[ha]\f[R] \->
\f[CR]\[rs]A\f[R], \f[CR]$\f[R] \-> \f[CR]\[rs]Z\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]l\f[R] \- Find longest possible matches
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]x\f[R] \- Extended regex format (ignore whitespace and comments)
.PP
To match a whitespace with the \f[CR]x\f[R] flag, use \f[CR]\[rs]s\f[R],

\f[CR]string\f[R] \- the string that it matched
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]captures\f[R] \- an array of objects representing capturing
groups.
.PP
Capturing group objects have the following fields:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]offset\f[R] \- offset in UTF\-8 codepoints from the beginning of
the input
.IP \[bu] 2

If there is no match, the stream is empty.
To capture all the matches for each input string, use the idiom
\f[CR][ expr ]\f[R], e.g.\ \f[CR][ scan(regex) ]\f[R].

\f[CR]tostring\f[R] should be a jq string or a stream of such strings,
each of which may contain references to named captures.
The named captures are, in effect, presented as a JSON object (as
constructed by \f[CR]capture\f[R]) to \f[CR]tostring\f[R], so a

.SH ADVANCED FEATURES
Variables are an absolute necessity in most programming languages, but
they\[cq]re relegated to an \[lq]advanced feature\[rq] in jq.
.PP
In most languages, variables are the only means of passing around data.
If you calculate a value, and you want to use it more than once,
you\[cq]ll need to store it in a variable.
To pass a value to another part of the program, you\[cq]ll need that
part of the program to define a variable (as a function parameter,
object member, or whatever) in which to place the data.
.PP
It is also possible to define functions in jq, although this is is a
feature whose biggest use is defining jq\[cq]s standard library (many jq
functions such as \f[CR]map\f[R] and \f[CR]select\f[R] are in fact
written in jq).
.PP
jq has reduction operators, which are very powerful but a bit tricky.
Again, these are mostly used internally, to define some useful bits of
jq\[cq]s standard library.
.PP
It may not be obvious at first, but jq is all about generators (yes, as
often found in other languages).
Some utilities are provided to help deal with generators.
.PP
Some minimal I/O support (besides reading JSON from standard input, and
writing JSON to standard output) is available.
.PP
Finally, there is a module/library system.
.SS Variable / Symbolic Binding Operator: \f[CR]... as $identifier | ...\f[R]
In jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual plumbing is
not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program to the next.
Many expressions, for instance \f[CR]a + b\f[R], pass their input to two
distinct subexpressions (here \f[CR]a\f[R] and \f[CR]b\f[R] are both
passed the same input), so variables aren\[cq]t usually necessary in
order to use a value twice.
.PP
For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers
requires a few variables in most languages \- at least one to hold the
array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter.
In jq, it\[cq]s simply \f[CR]add / length\f[R] \- the \f[CR]add\f[R]
expression is given the array and produces its sum, and the
\f[CR]length\f[R] expression is given the array and produces its length.
.PP
So, there\[cq]s generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jq
than defining variables.
Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jq lets you define
variables using \f[CR]expression as $variable\f[R].
All variable names start with \f[CR]$\f[R].
Here\[cq]s a slightly uglier version of the array\-averaging example:
.IP
.EX
length as $array_length | add / $array_length
.EE
.PP
We\[cq]ll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where
using variables actually makes our lives easier.
.PP
Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with \[lq]author\[rq] and
\[lq]title\[rq] fields, and another object which is used to map author
usernames to real names.
Our input looks like:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]posts\[dq]: [{\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]First post\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]anon\[dq]},
           {\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]A well\-written article\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]person1\[dq]}],
 \[dq]realnames\[dq]: {\[dq]anon\[dq]: \[dq]Anonymous Coward\[dq],
               \[dq]person1\[dq]: \[dq]Person McPherson\[dq]}}
.EE
.PP
We want to produce the posts with the author field containing a real
name, as in:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]First post\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]Anonymous Coward\[dq]}
{\[dq]title\[dq]: \[dq]A well\-written article\[dq], \[dq]author\[dq]: \[dq]Person McPherson\[dq]}
.EE
.PP
We use a variable, \f[CR]$names\f[R], to store the realnames object, so
that we can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:
.IP
.EX
\&.realnames as $names | .posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]}
.EE
.PP
The expression \f[CR]exp as $x | ...\f[R] means: for each value of
expression \f[CR]exp\f[R], run the rest of the pipeline with the entire
original input, and with \f[CR]$x\f[R] set to that value.
Thus \f[CR]as\f[R] functions as something of a foreach loop.
.PP
Just as \f[CR]{foo}\f[R] is a handy way of writing
\f[CR]{foo: .foo}\f[R], so \f[CR]{$foo}\f[R] is a handy way of writing
\f[CR]{foo: $foo}\f[R].
.PP
Multiple variables may be declared using a single \f[CR]as\f[R]
expression by providing a pattern that matches the structure of the
input (this is known as \[lq]destructuring\[rq]):
.IP
.EX
\&. as {realnames: $names, posts: [$first, $second]} | ...
.EE
.PP
The variable declarations in array patterns (e.g.,
\f[CR]. as [$first, $second]\f[R]) bind to the elements of the array in
from the element at index zero on up, in order.
When there is no value at the index for an array pattern element,
\f[CR]null\f[R] is bound to that variable.
.PP
Variables are scoped over the rest of the expression that defines them,
so
.IP
.EX
\&.realnames as $names | (.posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]})
.EE
.PP
will work, but
.IP
.EX
(.realnames as $names | .posts[]) | {title, author: $names[.author]}
.EE
.PP
won\[cq]t.
.PP
For programming language theorists, it\[cq]s more accurate to say that
jq variables are lexically\-scoped bindings.
In particular there\[cq]s no way to change the value of a binding; one
can only setup a new binding with the same name, but which will not be
visible where the old one was.

.SS Destructuring Alternative Operator: \f[CR]?//\f[R]
The destructuring alternative operator provides a concise mechanism for
destructuring an input that can take one of several forms.
.PP
Suppose we have an API that returns a list of resources and events
associated with them, and we want to get the user_id and timestamp of
the first event for each resource.
The API (having been clumsily converted from XML) will only wrap the
events in an array if the resource has multiple events:
.IP
.EX
{\[dq]resources\[dq]: [{\[dq]id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]kind\[dq]: \[dq]widget\[dq], \[dq]events\[dq]: {\[dq]action\[dq]: \[dq]create\[dq], \[dq]user_id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]ts\[dq]: 13}},
               {\[dq]id\[dq]: 2, \[dq]kind\[dq]: \[dq]widget\[dq], \[dq]events\[dq]: [{\[dq]action\[dq]: \[dq]create\[dq], \[dq]user_id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]ts\[dq]: 14}, {\[dq]action\[dq]: \[dq]destroy\[dq], \[dq]user_id\[dq]: 1, \[dq]ts\[dq]: 15}]}]}
.EE
.PP
We can use the destructuring alternative operator to handle this
structural change simply:
.IP
.EX
\&.resources[] as {$id, $kind, events: {$user_id, $ts}} ?// {$id, $kind, events: [{$user_id, $ts}]} | {$user_id, $kind, $id, $ts}
.EE
.PP
Or, if we aren\[cq]t sure if the input is an array of values or an
object:
.IP
.EX
\&.[] as [$id, $kind, $user_id, $ts] ?// {$id, $kind, $user_id, $ts} | ...
.EE
.PP
Each alternative need not define all of the same variables, but all
named variables will be available to the subsequent expression.
Variables not matched in the alternative that succeeded will be
\f[CR]null\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\&.resources[] as {$id, $kind, events: {$user_id, $ts}} ?// {$id, $kind, events: [{$first_user_id, $first_ts}]} | {$user_id, $first_user_id, $kind, $id, $ts, $first_ts}
.EE
.PP
Additionally, if the subsequent expression returns an error, the
alternative operator will attempt to try the next binding.
Errors that occur during the final alternative are passed through.
.IP
.EX
[[3]] | .[] as [$a] ?// [$b] | if $a != null then error(\[dq]err: \[rs]($a)\[dq]) else {$a,$b} end

.SS Defining Functions
You can give a filter a name using \[lq]def\[rq] syntax:
.IP
.EX
def increment: . + 1;
.EE
.PP
From then on, \f[CR]increment\f[R] is usable as a filter just like a
builtin function (in fact, this is how many of the builtins are
defined).
A function may take arguments:
.IP
.EX
def map(f): [.[] | f];
.EE
.PP
Arguments are passed as \f[I]filters\f[R] (functions with no arguments),
\f[I]not\f[R] as values.
The same argument may be referenced multiple times with different inputs
(here \f[CR]f\f[R] is run for each element of the input array).
Arguments to a function work more like callbacks than like value
arguments.
This is important to understand.
Consider:
.IP
.EX
def foo(f): f|f;
5|foo(.*2)
.EE
.PP
The result will be 20 because \f[CR]f\f[R] is \f[CR].*2\f[R], and during
the first invocation of \f[CR]f\f[R] \f[CR].\f[R] will be 5, and the
second time it will be 10 (5 * 2), so the result will be 20.
Function arguments are filters, and filters expect an input when
invoked.
.PP
If you want the value\-argument behaviour for defining simple functions,
you can just use a variable:
.IP
.EX
def addvalue(f): f as $f | map(. + $f);
.EE
.PP
Or use the short\-hand:
.IP
.EX
def addvalue($f): ...;
.EE
.PP
With either definition, \f[CR]addvalue(.foo)\f[R] will add the current
input\[cq]s \f[CR].foo\f[R] field to each element of the array.
Do note that calling \f[CR]addvalue(.[])\f[R] will cause the
\f[CR]map(. + $f)\f[R] part to be evaluated once per value in the value
of \f[CR].\f[R] at the call site.
.PP
Multiple definitions using the same function name are allowed.
Each re\-definition replaces the previous one for the same number of
function arguments, but only for references from functions (or main
program) subsequent to the re\-definition.
See also the section below on scoping.
.IP
.EX
$ echo \[aq][[1,2],[10,20]]\[aq] \[rs]

.EE
.SS Scoping
There are two types of symbols in jq: value bindings (a.k.a.,
\[lq]variables\[rq]), and functions.
Both are scoped lexically, with expressions being able to refer only to
symbols that have been defined \[lq]to the left\[rq] of them.
The only exception to this rule is that functions can refer to
themselves so as to be able to create recursive functions.
.PP
For example, in the following expression there is a binding which is
visible \[lq]to the right\[rq] of it,
\f[CR]... | .*3 as $times_three | [. + $times_three] | ...\f[R], but not
\[lq]to the left\[rq].
Consider this expression now,
\f[CR]... | (.*3 as $times_three | [. + $times_three]) | ...\f[R]: here
the binding \f[CR]$times_three\f[R] is \f[I]not\f[R] visible past the
closing parenthesis.
.SS \f[CR]isempty(exp)\f[R]
Returns true if \f[CR]exp\f[R] produces no outputs, false otherwise.

.SS \f[CR]reduce\f[R]
The \f[CR]reduce\f[R] syntax allows you to combine all of the results of
an expression by accumulating them into a single answer.
The form is \f[CR]reduce EXP as $var (INIT; UPDATE)\f[R].
As an example, we\[cq]ll pass \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] to this expression:
.IP
.EX
reduce .[] as $item (0; . + $item)
.EE
.PP
For each result that \f[CR].[]\f[R] produces, \f[CR]. + $item\f[R] is
run to accumulate a running total, starting from 0 as the input value.
In this example, \f[CR].[]\f[R] produces the results \f[CR]1\f[R],
\f[CR]2\f[R], and \f[CR]3\f[R], so the effect is similar to running
something like this:

.EE
.SS \f[CR]foreach\f[R]
The \f[CR]foreach\f[R] syntax is similar to \f[CR]reduce\f[R], but
intended to allow the construction of \f[CR]limit\f[R] and reducers that
produce intermediate results.
.PP
The form is \f[CR]foreach EXP as $var (INIT; UPDATE; EXTRACT)\f[R].
As an example, we\[cq]ll pass \f[CR][1,2,3]\f[R] to this expression:
.IP
.EX
foreach .[] as $item (0; . + $item; [$item, . * 2])
.EE
.PP
Like the \f[CR]reduce\f[R] syntax, \f[CR]. + $item\f[R] is run for each
result that \f[CR].[]\f[R] produces, but \f[CR][$item, . * 2]\f[R] is
run for each intermediate values.
In this example, since the intermediate values are \f[CR]1\f[R],
\f[CR]3\f[R], and \f[CR]6\f[R], the \f[CR]foreach\f[R] expression
produces \f[CR][1,2]\f[R], \f[CR][2,6]\f[R], and \f[CR][3,12]\f[R].
So the effect is similar to running something like this:
.IP
.EX
0 | 1 as $item | . + $item | [$item, . * 2],
    2 as $item | . + $item | [$item, . * 2],
    3 as $item | . + $item | [$item, . * 2]
.EE
.PP
When \f[CR]EXTRACT\f[R] is omitted, the identity filter is used.
That is, it outputs the intermediate values as they are.

.SS Recursion
As described above, \f[CR]recurse\f[R] uses recursion, and any jq
function can be recursive.
The \f[CR]while\f[R] builtin is also implemented in terms of recursion.
.PP
Tail calls are optimized whenever the expression to the left of the
recursive call outputs its last value.
In practice this means that the expression to the left of the recursive
call should not produce more than one output for each input.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.EX
def recurse(f): def r: ., (f | select(. != null) | r); r;

def while(cond; update):
  def _while:
    if cond then ., (update | _while) else empty end;
  _while;

def repeat(exp):
  def _repeat:
    exp, _repeat;
  _repeat;
.EE
.SS Generators and iterators
Some jq operators and functions are actually generators in that they can
produce zero, one, or more values for each input, just as one might
expect in other programming languages that have generators.
For example, \f[CR].[]\f[R] generates all the values in its input (which
must be an array or an object), \f[CR]range(0; 10)\f[R] generates the
integers between 0 and 10, and so on.
.PP
Even the comma operator is a generator, generating first the values
generated by the expression to the left of the comma, then the values
generated by the expression on the right of the comma.
.PP
The \f[CR]empty\f[R] builtin is the generator that produces zero
outputs.
The \f[CR]empty\f[R] builtin backtracks to the preceding generator
expression.
.PP
All jq functions can be generators just by using builtin generators.
It is also possible to construct new generators using only recursion and
the comma operator.
If recursive calls are \[lq]in tail position\[rq] then the generator
will be efficient.
In the example below the recursive call by \f[CR]_range\f[R] to itself
is in tail position.
The example shows off three advanced topics: tail recursion, generator
construction, and sub\-functions.

.SH MATH
jq currently only has IEEE754 double\-precision (64\-bit) floating point
number support.
.PP
Besides simple arithmetic operators such as \f[CR]+\f[R], jq also has
most standard math functions from the C math library.
C math functions that take a single input argument (e.g.,
\f[CR]sin()\f[R]) are available as zero\-argument jq functions.
C math functions that take two input arguments (e.g., \f[CR]pow()\f[R])
are available as two\-argument jq functions that ignore \f[CR].\f[R].
C math functions that take three input arguments are available as
three\-argument jq functions that ignore \f[CR].\f[R].
.PP
Availability of standard math functions depends on the availability of
the corresponding math functions in your operating system and C math
library.
Unavailable math functions will be defined but will raise an error.
.PP
One\-input C math functions: \f[CR]acos\f[R] \f[CR]acosh\f[R]

.SH I/O
At this time jq has minimal support for I/O, mostly in the form of
control over when inputs are read.
Two builtins functions are provided for this, \f[CR]input\f[R] and
\f[CR]inputs\f[R], that read from the same sources (e.g.,
\f[CR]stdin\f[R], files named on the command\-line) as jq itself.
These two builtins, and jq\[cq]s own reading actions, can be interleaved
with each other.
They are commonly used in combination with the null input option
\f[CR]\-n\f[R] to prevent one input from being read implicitly.
.PP
Two builtins provide minimal output capabilities, \f[CR]debug\f[R], and
\f[CR]stderr\f[R].
(Recall that a jq program\[cq]s output values are always output as JSON
texts on \f[CR]stdout\f[R].)
The \f[CR]debug\f[R] builtin can have application\-specific behavior,
such as for executables that use the libjq C API but aren\[cq]t the jq
executable itself.
The \f[CR]stderr\f[R] builtin outputs its input in raw mode to stder
with no additional decoration, not even a newline.
.PP
Most jq builtins are referentially transparent, and yield constant and
repeatable value streams when applied to constant inputs.
This is not true of I/O builtins.
.SS \f[CR]input\f[R]
Outputs one new input.
.PP
Note that when using \f[CR]input\f[R] it is generally be necessary to
invoke jq with the \f[CR]\-n\f[R] command\-line option, otherwise the
first entity will be lost.
.IP
.EX
echo 1 2 3 4 | jq \[aq][., input]\[aq] # [1,2] [3,4]
.EE
.SS \f[CR]inputs\f[R]
Outputs all remaining inputs, one by one.
.PP
This is primarily useful for reductions over a program\[cq]s inputs.
Note that when using \f[CR]inputs\f[R] it is generally necessary to
invoke jq with the \f[CR]\-n\f[R] command\-line option, otherwise the
first entity will be lost.
.IP
.EX
echo 1 2 3 | jq \-n \[aq]reduce inputs as $i (0; . + $i)\[aq] # 6
.EE
.SS \f[CR]debug\f[R], \f[CR]debug(msgs)\f[R]
These two filters are like \f[CR].\f[R] but have as a side\-effect the
production of one or more messages on stderr.
.PP
The message produced by the \f[CR]debug\f[R] filter has the form
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]DEBUG:\[dq],<input\-value>]
.EE
.PP
where \f[CR]<input\-value>\f[R] is a compact rendition of the input
value.
This format may change in the future.
.PP
The \f[CR]debug(msgs)\f[R] filter is defined as
\f[CR](msgs | debug | empty), .\f[R] thus allowing great flexibility in
the content of the message, while also allowing multi\-line debugging
statements to be created.
.PP
For example, the expression:
.IP
.EX
1 as $x | 2 | debug(\[dq]Entering function foo with $x == \[rs]($x)\[dq], .) | (.+1)
.EE
.PP
would produce the value 3 but with the following two lines being written
to stderr:
.IP
.EX
[\[dq]DEBUG:\[dq],\[dq]Entering function foo with $x == 1\[dq]]
[\[dq]DEBUG:\[dq],2]
.EE
.SS \f[CR]stderr\f[R]
Prints its input in raw and compact mode to stderr with no additional
decoration, not even a newline.
.SS \f[CR]input_filename\f[R]
Returns the name of the file whose input is currently being filtered.
Note that this will not work well unless jq is running in a UTF\-8
locale.
.SS \f[CR]input_line_number\f[R]
Returns the line number of the input currently being filtered.
.SH STREAMING
With the \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R] option jq can parse input texts in a
streaming fashion, allowing jq programs to start processing large JSON
texts immediately rather than after the parse completes.
If you have a single JSON text that is 1GB in size, streaming it will
allow you to process it much more quickly.
.PP
However, streaming isn\[cq]t easy to deal with as the jq program will
have \f[CR][<path>, <leaf\-value>]\f[R] (and a few other forms) as
inputs.
.PP
Several builtins are provided to make handling streams easier.
.PP
The examples below use the streamed form of \f[CR][0,[1]]\f[R], which is
\f[CR][[0],0],[[1,0],1],[[1,0]],[[1]]\f[R].
.PP
Streaming forms include \f[CR][<path>, <leaf\-value>]\f[R] (to indicate
any scalar value, empty array, or empty object), and \f[CR][<path>]\f[R]
(to indicate the end of an array or object).
Future versions of jq run with \f[CR]\-\-stream\f[R] and
\f[CR]\-\-seq\f[R] may output additional forms such as
\f[CR][\[dq]error message\[dq]]\f[R] when an input text fails to parse.
.SS \f[CR]truncate_stream(stream_expression)\f[R]
Consumes a number as input and truncates the corresponding number of
path elements from the left of the outputs of the given streaming
expression.
.IP
.EX
$ echo \[aq]1\[aq] \[rs]
  | jq \[aq]truncate_stream([[0],1],[[1,0],2],[[1,0]],[[1]])\[aq]

.EE
.SH ASSIGNMENT
Assignment works a little differently in jq than in most programming
languages.
jq doesn\[cq]t distinguish between references to and copies of something
\- two objects or arrays are either equal or not equal, without any
further notion of being \[lq]the same object\[rq] or \[lq]not the same
object\[rq].
.PP
If an object has two fields which are arrays, \f[CR].foo\f[R] and
\f[CR].bar\f[R], and you append something to \f[CR].foo\f[R], then
\f[CR].bar\f[R] will not get bigger, even if you\[cq]ve previously set
\f[CR].bar = .foo\f[R].
If you\[cq]re used to programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby,
JavaScript, etc.
then you can think of it as though jq does a full deep copy of every
object before it does the assignment (for performance it doesn\[cq]t
actually do that, but that\[cq]s the general idea).
.PP
This means that it\[cq]s impossible to build circular values in jq (such
as an array whose first element is itself).
This is quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jq program can
produce can be represented in JSON.
.PP
All the assignment operators in jq have path expressions on the
left\-hand side (LHS).
The right\-hand side (RHS) provides values to set to the paths named by
the LHS path expressions.
.PP
Values in jq are always immutable.
Internally, assignment works by using a reduction to compute new,
replacement values for \f[CR].\f[R] that have had all the desired
assignments applied to \f[CR].\f[R], then outputting the modified value.
This might be made clear by this example:
\f[CR]{a:{b:{c:1}}} | (.a.b|=3), .\f[R].
This will output \f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]:{\[dq]b\[dq]:3}}\f[R] and
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]:{\[dq]b\[dq]:{\[dq]c\[dq]:1}}}\f[R] because the last
sub\-expression, \f[CR].\f[R], sees the original value, not the modified
value.
.PP
Most users will want to use modification assignment operators, such as
\f[CR]|=\f[R] or \f[CR]+=\f[R], rather than \f[CR]=\f[R].
.PP
Note that the LHS of assignment operators refers to a value in
\f[CR].\f[R].
Thus \f[CR]$var.foo = 1\f[R] won\[cq]t work as expected
(\f[CR]$var.foo\f[R] is not a valid or useful path expression in
\f[CR].\f[R]); use \f[CR]$var | .foo = 1\f[R] instead.
.PP
Note too that \f[CR].a,.b=0\f[R] does not set \f[CR].a\f[R] and
\f[CR].b\f[R], but \f[CR](.a,.b)=0\f[R] sets both.
.SS Update\-assignment: \f[CR]|=\f[R]
This is the \[lq]update\[rq] operator \f[CR]|=\f[R].
It takes a filter on the right\-hand side and works out the new value
for the property of \f[CR].\f[R] being assigned to by running the old
value through this expression.
For instance, \f[CR](.foo, .bar) |= .+1\f[R] will build an object with
the \f[CR]foo\f[R] field set to the input\[cq]s \f[CR]foo\f[R] plus 1,
and the \f[CR]bar\f[R] field set to the input\[cq]s \f[CR]bar\f[R] plus
1.
.PP
The left\-hand side can be any general path expression; see
\f[CR]path()\f[R].
.PP
Note that the left\-hand side of \f[CR]|=\f[R] refers to a value in
\f[CR].\f[R].
Thus \f[CR]$var.foo |= . + 1\f[R] won\[cq]t work as expected
(\f[CR]$var.foo\f[R] is not a valid or useful path expression in
\f[CR].\f[R]); use \f[CR]$var | .foo |= . + 1\f[R] instead.
.PP
If the right\-hand side outputs no values (i.e., \f[CR]empty\f[R]), then
the left\-hand side path will be deleted, as with \f[CR]del(path)\f[R].
.PP
If the right\-hand side outputs multiple values, only the first one will
be used (COMPATIBILITY NOTE: in jq 1.5 and earlier releases, it used to
be that only the last one was used).

jq has a few operators of the form \f[CR]a op= b\f[R], which are all
equivalent to \f[CR]a |= . op b\f[R].
So, \f[CR]+= 1\f[R] can be used to increment values, being the same as
\f[CR]|= . + 1\f[R].

.SS Plain assignment: \f[CR]=\f[R]
This is the plain assignment operator.
Unlike the others, the input to the right\-hand side (RHS) is the same
as the input to the left\-hand side (LHS) rather than the value at the
LHS path, and all values output by the RHS will be used (as shown
below).
.PP
If the RHS of \f[CR]=\f[R] produces multiple values, then for each such
value jq will set the paths on the left\-hand side to the value and then
it will output the modified \f[CR].\f[R].
For example, \f[CR](.a,.b) = range(2)\f[R] outputs
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]:0,\[dq]b\[dq]:0}\f[R], then
\f[CR]{\[dq]a\[dq]:1,\[dq]b\[dq]:1}\f[R].
The \[lq]update\[rq] assignment forms (see above) do not do this.

.SS Complex assignments
Lots more things are allowed on the left\-hand side of a jq assignment
than in most languages.
We\[cq]ve already seen simple field accesses on the left hand side, and
it\[cq]s no surprise that array accesses work just as well:
.IP
.EX
\&.posts[0].title = \[dq]JQ Manual\[dq]
.EE
.PP
What may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may
produce multiple results, referring to different points in the input
document:
.IP
.EX
\&.posts[].comments |= . + [\[dq]this is great\[dq]]
.EE
.PP
That example appends the string \[lq]this is great\[rq] to the
\[lq]comments\[rq] array of each post in the input (where the input is
an object with a field \[lq]posts\[rq] which is an array of posts).
.PP
When jq encounters an assignment like `a = b', it records the
\[lq]path\[rq] taken to select a part of the input document while
executing a.
This path is then used to find which part of the input to change while
executing the assignment.
Any filter may be used on the left\-hand side of an equals \- whichever
paths it selects from the input will be where the assignment is
performed.
.PP
This is a very powerful operation.
Suppose we wanted to add a comment to blog posts, using the same
\[lq]blog\[rq] input above.
This time, we only want to comment on the posts written by
\[lq]stedolan\[rq].
We can find those posts using the \[lq]select\[rq] function described
earlier:
.IP
.EX
\&.posts[] | select(.author == \[dq]stedolan\[dq])
.EE
.PP
The paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that
\[lq]stedolan\[rq] wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same
way that we did before:
.IP
.EX
(.posts[] | select(.author == \[dq]stedolan\[dq]) | .comments) |=
    . + [\[dq]terrible.\[dq]]
.EE
.SH COMMENTS
You can write comments in your jq filters using \f[CR]#\f[R].
.PP
A \f[CR]#\f[R] character (not part of a string) starts a comment.
All characters from \f[CR]#\f[R] to the end of the line are ignored.
.PP
If the end of the line is preceded by an odd number of backslash
characters, the following line is also considered part of the comment
and is ignored.
.PP
For example, the following code outputs \f[CR][1,3,4,7]\f[R]
.IP
.EX
[
  1,
  # foo \[rs]
  2,
  # bar \[rs]\[rs]
  3,
  4, # baz \[rs]\[rs]\[rs]
  5, \[rs]
  6,
  7
  # comment \[rs]
    comment \[rs]
    comment
]
.EE
.PP
Backslash continuing the comment on the next line can be useful when
writing the \[lq]shebang\[rq] for a jq script:
.IP
.EX
#!/bin/sh \-\-
# total \- Output the sum of the given arguments (or stdin)
# usage: total [numbers...]
# \[rs]
exec jq \-\-args \-MRnf \[dq]$0\[dq] \-\- \[dq]$\[at]\[dq]

$ARGS.positional |
reduce (
  if . == []
    then inputs
    else .[]
  end |
  . as $dot |
  try tonumber catch false |
  if not or isnan then
    \[at]json \[dq]total: Invalid number \[rs]($dot).\[rs]n\[dq] | halt_error(1)
  end
) as $n (0; . + $n)
.EE
.PP
The \f[CR]exec\f[R] line is considered a comment by jq, so it is
ignored.
But it is not ignored by \f[CR]sh\f[R], since in \f[CR]sh\f[R] a
backslash at the end of the line does not continue the comment.
With this trick, when the script is invoked as \f[CR]total 1 2\f[R],
\f[CR]/bin/sh \-\- /path/to/total 1 2\f[R] will be run, and
\f[CR]sh\f[R] will then run
\f[CR]exec jq \-\-args \-MRnf /path/to/total \-\- 1 2\f[R] replacing
itself with a \f[CR]jq\f[R] interpreter invoked with the specified
options (\f[CR]\-M\f[R], \f[CR]\-R\f[R], \f[CR]\-n\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\-args\f[R]), that evaluates the current file (\f[CR]$0\f[R]),
with the arguments (\f[CR]$\[at]\f[R]) that were passed to
\f[CR]sh\f[R].
.SH MODULES
jq has a library/module system.
Modules are files whose names end in \f[CR].jq\f[R].
.PP
Modules imported by a program are searched for in a default search path
(see below).
The \f[CR]import\f[R] and \f[CR]include\f[R] directives allow the
importer to alter this path.
.PP
Paths in the search path are subject to various substitutions.
.PP
For paths starting with \f[CR]\[ti]/\f[R], the user\[cq]s home directory
is substituted for \f[CR]\[ti]\f[R].
.PP
For paths starting with \f[CR]$ORIGIN/\f[R], the directory where the jq
executable is located is substituted for \f[CR]$ORIGIN\f[R].
.PP
For paths starting with \f[CR]./\f[R] or paths that are \f[CR].\f[R],
the path of the including file is substituted for \f[CR].\f[R].
For top\-level programs given on the command\-line, the current
directory is used.
.PP
Import directives can optionally specify a search path to which the
default is appended.
.PP
The default search path is the search path given to the \f[CR]\-L\f[R]
command\-line option, else
\f[CR][\[dq]\[ti]/.jq\[dq], \[dq]$ORIGIN/../lib/jq\[dq], \[dq]$ORIGIN/../lib\[dq]]\f[R].
.PP
Null and empty string path elements terminate search path processing.
.PP
A dependency with relative path \f[CR]foo/bar\f[R] would be searched for
in \f[CR]foo/bar.jq\f[R] and \f[CR]foo/bar/bar.jq\f[R] in the given
search path.
This is intended to allow modules to be placed in a directory along
with, for example, version control files, README files, and so on, but
also to allow for single\-file modules.
.PP
Consecutive components with the same name are not allowed to avoid
ambiguities (e.g., \f[CR]foo/foo\f[R]).
.PP
For example, with \f[CR]\-L$HOME/.jq\f[R] a module \f[CR]foo\f[R] can be
found in \f[CR]$HOME/.jq/foo.jq\f[R] and
\f[CR]$HOME/.jq/foo/foo.jq\f[R].
.PP
If \f[CR].jq\f[R] exists in the user\[cq]s home directory, and is a file
(not a directory), it is automatically sourced into the main program.
.SS \f[CR]import RelativePathString as NAME [<metadata>];\f[R]
Imports a module found at the given path relative to a directory in a
search path.
A \f[CR].jq\f[R] suffix will be added to the relative path string.
The module\[cq]s symbols are prefixed with \f[CR]NAME::\f[R].
.PP
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression.
It should be an object with keys like \f[CR]homepage\f[R] and so on.
At this time jq only uses the \f[CR]search\f[R] key/value of the
metadata.
The metadata is also made available to users via the
\f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.PP
The \f[CR]search\f[R] key in the metadata, if present, should have a
string or array value (array of strings); this is the search path to be
prefixed to the top\-level search path.
.SS \f[CR]include RelativePathString [<metadata>];\f[R]
Imports a module found at the given path relative to a directory in a
search path as if it were included in place.
A \f[CR].jq\f[R] suffix will be added to the relative path string.
The module\[cq]s symbols are imported into the caller\[cq]s namespace as
if the module\[cq]s content had been included directly.
.PP
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression.
It should be an object with keys like \f[CR]homepage\f[R] and so on.
At this time jq only uses the \f[CR]search\f[R] key/value of the
metadata.
The metadata is also made available to users via the
\f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.SS \f[CR]import RelativePathString as $NAME [<metadata>];\f[R]
Imports a JSON file found at the given path relative to a directory in a
search path.
A \f[CR].json\f[R] suffix will be added to the relative path string.
The file\[cq]s data will be available as \f[CR]$NAME::NAME\f[R].
.PP
The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression.
It should be an object with keys like \f[CR]homepage\f[R] and so on.
At this time jq only uses the \f[CR]search\f[R] key/value of the
metadata.
The metadata is also made available to users via the
\f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.PP
The \f[CR]search\f[R] key in the metadata, if present, should have a
string or array value (array of strings); this is the search path to be
prefixed to the top\-level search path.
.SS \f[CR]module <metadata>;\f[R]
This directive is entirely optional.
It\[cq]s not required for proper operation.
It serves only the purpose of providing metadata that can be read with
the \f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.PP
The metadata must be a constant jq expression.
It should be an object with keys like \f[CR]homepage\f[R].
At this time jq doesn\[cq]t use this metadata, but it is made available
to users via the \f[CR]modulemeta\f[R] builtin.
.SS \f[CR]modulemeta\f[R]
Takes a module name as input and outputs the module\[cq]s metadata as an
object, with the module\[cq]s imports (including metadata) as an array
value for the \f[CR]deps\f[R] key and the module\[cq]s defined functions
as an array value for the \f[CR]defs\f[R] key.
.PP
Programs can use this to query a module\[cq]s metadata, which they could
then use to, for example, search for, download, and install missing
dependencies.
.SH COLORS
To configure alternative colors just set the \f[CR]JQ_COLORS\f[R]
environment variable to colon\-delimited list of partial terminal escape
sequences like \f[CR]\[dq]1;31\[dq]\f[R], in this order:
.IP \[bu] 2
color for \f[CR]null\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
color for \f[CR]false\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
color for \f[CR]true\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
color for numbers
.IP \[bu] 2
color for strings
.IP \[bu] 2
color for arrays
.IP \[bu] 2
color for objects
.IP \[bu] 2
color for object keys
.PP
The default color scheme is the same as setting
\f[CR]JQ_COLORS=\[dq]0;90:0;39:0;39:0;39:0;32:1;39:1;39:1;34\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
This is not a manual for VT100/ANSI escapes.
However, each of these color specifications should consist of two
numbers separated by a semi\-colon, where the first number is one of
these:
.IP \[bu] 2
1 (bright)
.IP \[bu] 2
2 (dim)
.IP \[bu] 2
4 (underscore)
.IP \[bu] 2
5 (blink)
.IP \[bu] 2
7 (reverse)
.IP \[bu] 2
8 (hidden)
.PP
and the second is one of these:
.IP \[bu] 2
30 (black)
.IP \[bu] 2
31 (red)
.IP \[bu] 2
32 (green)
.IP \[bu] 2
33 (yellow)
.IP \[bu] 2
34 (blue)
.IP \[bu] 2
35 (magenta)
.IP \[bu] 2
36 (cyan)
.IP \[bu] 2
37 (white)

headline: Download jq

  - text: |

      jq is written in C and has no runtime dependencies, so it should be
      possible to build it for nearly any platform. Prebuilt binaries are
      available for Linux, macOS and Windows.

      The binaries should just run, but on macOS and Linux you may need
      to make them executable first using `chmod +x jq`.

      jq is licensed under the MIT license. For all of the gory
      details, read the file `COPYING` in the source distribution.

      jq uses a C library for decimal number support. This is an ICU 1.8.1
      licensed code obtained from the ICU downloads archive.

      ### Checksums and signatures

      SHA-256 checksums are provided for all release and pre-release binaries.
      They can be found under
      [sig/v1.x/sha256sum.txt](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/tree/master/sig).
      The checksums for jq 1.7 are in
      [sig/v1.7/sha256sum.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqlang/jq/master/sig/v1.7/sha256sum.txt).
      The checksums for jq 1.6 are in
      [sig/v1.6/sha256sum.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqlang/jq/master/sig/v1.6/sha256sum.txt).
      The checksums for jq 1.5 are in
      [sig/v1.5/sha256sum.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqlang/jq/master/sig/v1.5/sha256sum.txt).

      Additionally, all release artifacts are signed by a jq release key.  We have two release keys, [one for 1.6 and older releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqlang/jq/master/sig/jq-release-old.key), and [one for 1.7 and newer releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqlang/jq/master/sig/jq-release-new.key).
      Signatures can be found under
      [sig/v1.x/\*.asc](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/tree/master/sig).
      The signatures for jq 1.7 are in
      [sig/v1.7/\*.asc](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/tree/master/sig/v1.7).
      The signatures for jq 1.6 are in
      [sig/v1.6/\*.asc](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/tree/master/sig/v1.6).
      The signatures for jq 1.5 are in
      [sig/v1.5/\*.asc](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/tree/master/sig/v1.5).
      You can use [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) to verify a signature by downloading
      the signature and running `gpg --verify signature.asc`.

      ### From source on Linux, macOS, Cygwin, and other POSIX-like operating systems

       * [Source tarball for jq 1.7](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/download/jq-1.7/jq-1.7.tar.gz)
       * [Source tarball for jq 1.6](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-1.6.tar.gz)
       * [Source tarball for jq 1.5](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/download/jq-1.5/jq-1.5.tar.gz)

      You can build it using the usual `./configure && make && sudo
      make install` rigmarole.

      If you're interested in using the latest development version, try:

          git clone --recursive https://github.com/jqlang/jq.git
          cd jq
          autoreconf -i
          ./configure
          make
          sudo make install

      To build it from a git clone, you'll need to install a few
      packages first:

       * [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)
       * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
       * [Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)

      For Linux systems, these will all be in your system's package
      manager, and if you do development on the machine they're most
      likely already installed.

      On macOS, these are all included in Apple's command line tools, which can
      be installed from [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). However,
      you may find that you need a newer version of Bison than the one provided
      by Apple. This can be found in [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or
      [MacPorts](https://macports.org/).

      If you want to generate the lexer and parser from source you can use the
      `--enable-maintainer-mode` configure flag. This requires bison to be installed.
      [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) and
      [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/).

      ### Docker

      Docker image is available from
      [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/pkgs/container/jq).

          docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/jqlang/jq -n 'range(3)'

      #### Building the documentation

      jq's documentation is compiled into static HTML using Python.
      To build the docs, run `pipenv run python3 build_website.py --root /output`
      in the `docs/` directory. To serve them locally, you can run
      `python3 -m http.server`. You'll need a few Python dependencies,
      which can be installed by following the instructions in `docs/README.md`.

      The man page is built by `make jq.1`, or just `make`, also from
      the YAML docs, and you'll still need the Python dependencies to
      build the manpage.

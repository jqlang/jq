headline: Download jq
body:

  - text: |

      jq is written in C and has no runtime dependencies, so it should be
      possible to build it for nearly any platform. Prebuilt binaries are
      available for Linux (64-bit x86) and OS X.
    
       * [Download binary for 64-bit Linux](linux_x86_64/jq)
       * [Download binary for OS X](osx_64/jq)
         (or use [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/): `brew install jq`) 
       * [Download source](source/jq.tgz)

      The binaries should just run, but you may need to make them
      executable first using:

          chmod +x jq
       
      jq is licensed under the MIT license. For all of the gory
      details, read the file `COPYING` in the source distribution.

      Arch Linux
      ----------

      A PKGBUILD for jq-1.1 is in the
      [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=63849), as well as a
      PKGBUILD for the HEAD of master
      ([jq-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=63850)).

      You can install jq using [Yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt)
      or manually by following instructions on
      [Arch Linux's Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).

      Hacking on jq
      =============

      If you want to work on jq, grab the source from
      [https://github.com/stedolan/jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq).
        

      To build it from a git clone, you'll need to install a few
      packages first:

       * [Flex](http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/)
       * [Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
       * [Python](http://www.python.org)
       * [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org)
       * [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make)

      Most of these aren't necessary if you're just trying to compile
      jq from the released tarball - that version has the
      non-platform-specific build steps already done, so you'll only
      need a C compiler and `make` to finish it off.

      For Linux systems, these will all be in your system's package
      manager, and if you do development on the machine they're most
      likely already installed. I have no idea how to get these
      installed on OS X, you're on your own there.

      `flex` and `bison` are used to generate the lexer and parser for
      jq, and some python scripts generate the UTF8 encoding tables
      needed for JSON parsing.

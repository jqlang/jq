headline: jq Manual
body: |

  A jq program is a "filter": it takes an input, and produces an
  output. There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a
  particular field of an object, or converting a number to a string,
  or various other standard tasks.

  Filters can be combined in various ways - you can pipe the output of
  one filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter
  into an array.

  Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there's one that
  produces all the elements of its input array. Piping that filter
  into a second runs the second filter for each element of the
  array. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration
  in other languages are just done by gluing filters together in jq.

  It's important to remember that every filter has an input and an
  output. Even literals like "hello" or 42 are filters - they take an
  input but always produce the same literal as output. Operations that
  combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to
  both and combine the results. So, you can implement an averaging
  filter as `add / length` - feeding the input array both to the `add`
  filter and the `length` filter and then performing the division.

  But that's getting ahead of ourselves. :) Let's start with something
  simpler:

  jq(1) -- Command-line JSON processor
  ====================================

  ## SYNOPSIS

  `jq` [<options>...] <filter> [<files>...]

  `jq` can transform JSON in various ways, by selecting, iterating,
  reducing and otherwise mangling JSON documents. For instance,
  running the command `jq 'map(.price) | add'` will take an array of
  JSON objects as input and return the sum of their "price" fields.

  `jq` can accept text input as well, but by default, `jq` reads a
  stream of JSON entities (including numbers and other literals) from
  `stdin`. Whitespace is only needed to separate entities such as 1
  and 2, and true and false.  One or more <files> may be specified, in
  which case `jq` will read input from those instead.

  The <options> are described in the [INVOKING JQ] section; they
  mostly concern input and output formatting. The <filter> is written
  in the jq language and specifies how to transform the input
  file or document.

  - title: Invoking jq
    body: |

      jq filters run on a stream of JSON data. The input to jq is
      parsed as a sequence of whitespace-separated JSON values which
      are passed through the provided filter one at a time. The
      output(s) of the filter are written to standard out, again as a
      sequence of whitespace-separated JSON data.

      Note: it is important to mind the shell's quoting rules.  As a
      general rule it's best to always quote (with single-quote
      characters) the jq program, as too many characters with special
      meaning to jq are also shell meta-characters.  For example, `jq
      "foo"` will fail on most Unix shells because that will be the same
      as `jq foo`, which will generally fail because `foo is not
      defined`.  When using the Windows command shell (cmd.exe) it's
      best to use double quotes around your jq program when given on the
      command-line (instead of the `-f program-file` option), but then
      double-quotes in the jq program need backslash escaping.

      You can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output
      using some command-line options:

      * `--version`:

        Output the jq version and exit with zero.

      * `--slurp`/`-s`:

        Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the
        input, read the entire input stream into a large array and run
        the filter just once.

      * `--raw-input`/`-R`:

        Don't parse the input as JSON. Instead, each line of text is
        passed to the filter as a string. If combined with `--slurp`,
        then the entire input is passed to the filter as a single long
        string.

      * `--null-input`/`-n`:

        Don't read any input at all! Instead, the filter is run once
        using `null` as the input. This is useful when using jq as a
        simple calculator or to construct JSON data from scratch.

      * `--compact-output` / `-c`:

        By default, jq pretty-prints JSON output. Using this option
        will result in more compact output by instead putting each
        JSON object on a single line.

      * `--colour-output` / `-C` and `--monochrome-output` / `-M`:

        By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a
        terminal. You can force it to produce color even if writing to
        a pipe or a file using `-C`, and disable color with `-M`.

      * `--ascii-output` / `-a`:

        jq usually outputs non-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF-8, even
        if the input specified them as escape sequences (like
        "\u03bc"). Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure
        ASCII output with every non-ASCII character replaced with the
        equivalent escape sequence.

      * `--unbuffered`

        Flush the output after each JSON object is printed (useful if
        you're piping a slow data source into jq and piping jq's
        output elsewhere).

      * `--sort-keys` / `-S`:

        Output the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order.

      * `--raw-output` / `-r`:

        With this option, if the filter's result is a string then it
        will be written directly to standard output rather than being
        formatted as a JSON string with quotes. This can be useful for
        making jq filters talk to non-JSON-based systems.

      * `--join-output` / `-j`:

        Like `-r` but jq won't print a newline after each output.

      * `--in-place` / `-i`:

        Edit the (first) file in-place.

      * `-f filename` / `--from-file filename`:

        Read filter from the file rather than from a command line, like
        awk's -f option. You can also use '#' to make comments.

      * `-Ldirectory` / `-L directory`:

        Add `directory` to the search list for modules.  See the section
        on modules below.

      * `-e` / `--exit-status`:

        Sets the exit status of jq to 0 if the last output values was
        neither `false` nor `null`, 1 if the last output value was
        either `false` or `null`, or 4 if no valid result was ever
        produced.  Normally jq exits with 2 if there was any usage
        problem or system error, 3 if there was a jq program compile
        error, or 0 if the jq program ran.

      * `--arg name value`:

        This option passes a value to the jq program as a predefined
        variable. If you run jq with `--arg foo bar`, then `$foo` is
        available in the program and has the value `"bar"`.

      * `--argfile name filename`:

        This option passes the first value from the named file as a
        value to the jq program as a predefined variable. If you run jq
        with `--argfile foo bar`, then `$foo` is available in the
        program and has the value resulting from parsing the content of
        the file named `bar`.

  - title: Basic filters
    entries:
      - title: "`.`"
        body: |

          The absolute simplest (and least interesting) filter
          is `.`. This is a filter that takes its input and
          produces it unchanged as output.

          Since jq by default pretty-prints all output, this trivial
          program can be a useful way of formatting JSON output from,
          say, `curl`.

        examples:
          - program: '.'
            input: '"Hello, world!"'
            output: ['"Hello, world!"']

      - title: "`.foo`, `.foo.bar`"
        body: |

          The simplest *useful* filter is `.foo`. When given a
          JSON object (aka dictionary or hash) as input, it produces
          the value at the key "foo", or null if there's none present.

          If the key contains special characters, you need to surround
          it with double quotes like this: `."foo$"`.

          A filter of the form `.foo.bar` is equivalent to `.foo|.bar`.

        examples:
          - program: '.foo'
            input: '{"foo": 42, "bar": "less interesting data"}'
            output: [42]
          - program: '.foo'
            input: '{"notfoo": true, "alsonotfoo": false}'
            output: ['null']
          - program: '.["foo"]'
            input: '{"foo": 42}'
            output: [42]

      - title: "`.foo?`"
        body: |

          Just like `.foo`, but does not output even an error when `.`
          is not an array or an object.

        examples:
          - program: '.foo?'
            input: '{"foo": 42, "bar": "less interesting data"}'
            output: [42]
          - program: '.foo?'
            input: '{"notfoo": true, "alsonotfoo": false}'
            output: ['null']
          - program: '.["foo"]?'
            input: '{"foo": 42}'
            output: [42]
          - program: '[.foo?]'
            input: '[1,2]'
            output: ['[]']

      - title: "`.[<string>]`, `.[2]`, `.[10:15]`"
        body: |

          You can also look up fields of an object using syntax like
          `.["foo"]` (.foo above is a shorthand version of this). This
          one works for arrays as well, if the key is an
          integer. Arrays are zero-based (like javascript), so `.[2]`
          returns the third element of the array.

          The `.[10:15]` syntax can be used to return a subarray of an
          array or substring of a string. The array returned by
          `.[10:15]` will be of length 5, containing the elements from
          index 10 (inclusive) to index 15 (exclusive). Either index may
          be negative (in which case it counts backwards from the end of
          the array), or omitted (in which case it refers to the start
          or end of the array).

          The `.[2]` syntax can be used to return the element at the
          given index.  Negative indices are allowed, with -1 referring
          to the last element, -2 referring to the next to last element,
          and so on.

          The `?` "operator" can also be used with the slice operator,
          as in `.[10:15]?`, which outputs values where the inputs are
          slice-able.

        examples:
          - program: '.[0]'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output: ['{"name":"JSON", "good":true}']

          - program: '.[2]'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output: ['null']

          - program: '.[2:4]'
            input: '["a","b","c","d","e"]'
            output: ['["c", "d"]']

          - program: '.[2:4]'
            input: '"abcdefghi"'
            output: ['"cd"']

          - program: '.[:3]'
            input: '["a","b","c","d","e"]'
            output: ['["a", "b", "c"]']

          - program: '.[-2:]'
            input: '["a","b","c","d","e"]'
            output: ['["d", "e"]']

          - program: '.[-2]'
            input: '[1,2,3]'
            output: ['2']

      - title: "`.[]`"
        body: |

          If you use the `.[index]` syntax, but omit the index
          entirely, it will return *all* of the elements of an
          array. Running `.[]` with the input `[1,2,3]` will produce the
          numbers as three separate results, rather than as a single
          array.

          You can also use this on an object, and it will return all
          the values of the object.

        examples:
          - program: '.[]'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output:
              - '{"name":"JSON", "good":true}'
              - '{"name":"XML", "good":false}'

          - program: '.[]'
            input: '[]'
            output: []

          - program: '.[]'
            input: '{"a": 1, "b": 1}'
            output: ['1', '1']

      - title: "`.[]?`"
        body: |

          Like `.[]`, but no errors will be output if . is not an array
          or object.

      - title: "`,`"
        body: |

          If two filters are separated by a comma, then the
          input will be fed into both and there will be multiple
          outputs: first, all of the outputs produced by the left
          expression, and then all of the outputs produced by the
          right. For instance, filter `.foo, .bar`, produces
          both the "foo" fields and "bar" fields as separate outputs.

        examples:
          - program: '.foo, .bar'
            input: '{"foo": 42, "bar": "something else", "baz": true}'
            output: ['42', '"something else"']

          - program: ".user, .projects[]"
            input: '{"user":"stedolan", "projects": ["jq", "wikiflow"]}'
            output: ['"stedolan"', '"jq"', '"wikiflow"']

          - program: '.[4,2]'
            input: '["a","b","c","d","e"]'
            output: ['"e"', '"c"']

      - title: "`|`"
        body: |
          The | operator combines two filters by feeding the output(s) of
          the one on the left into the input of the one on the right. It's
          pretty much the same as the Unix shell's pipe, if you're used to
          that.

          If the one on the left produces multiple results, the one on
          the right will be run for each of those results. So, the
          expression `.[] | .foo` retrieves the "foo" field of each
          element of the input array.

        examples:
          - program: '.[] | .name'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output: ['"JSON"', '"XML"']

  - title: Types and Values
    body: |

      jq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON - numbers,
      strings, booleans, arrays, objects (which in JSON-speak are
      hashes with only string keys), and "null".

      Booleans, null, strings and numbers are written the same way as
      in javascript. Just like everything else in jq, these simple
      values take an input and produce an output - `42` is a valid jq
      expression that takes an input, ignores it, and returns 42
      instead.

    entries:
      - title: Array construction - `[]`
        body: |

          As in JSON, `[]` is used to construct arrays, as in
          `[1,2,3]`. The elements of the arrays can be any jq
          expression. All of the results produced by all of the
          expressions are collected into one big array. You can use it
          to construct an array out of a known quantity of values (as
          in `[.foo, .bar, .baz]`) or to "collect" all the results of a
          filter into an array (as in `[.items[].name]`)

          Once you understand the "," operator, you can look at jq's array
          syntax in a different light: the expression `[1,2,3]` is not using a
          built-in syntax for comma-separated arrays, but is instead applying
          the `[]` operator (collect results) to the expression 1,2,3 (which
          produces three different results).

          If you have a filter `X` that produces four results,
          then the expression `[X]` will produce a single result, an
          array of four elements.

        examples:
          - program: "[.user, .projects[]]"
            input: '{"user":"stedolan", "projects": ["jq", "wikiflow"]}'
            output: ['["stedolan", "jq", "wikiflow"]']
      - title: Objects - `{}`
        body: |

          Like JSON, `{}` is for constructing objects (aka
          dictionaries or hashes), as in: `{"a": 42, "b": 17}`.

          If the keys are "sensible" (all alphabetic characters), then
          the quotes can be left off. The value can be any expression
          (although you may need to wrap it in parentheses if it's a
          complicated one), which gets applied to the {} expression's
          input (remember, all filters have an input and an
          output).

              {foo: .bar}

          will produce the JSON object `{"foo": 42}` if given the JSON
          object `{"bar":42, "baz":43}`. You can use this to select
          particular fields of an object: if the input is an object
          with "user", "title", "id", and "content" fields and you
          just want "user" and "title", you can write

              {user: .user, title: .title}

          Because that's so common, there's a shortcut syntax: `{user, title}`.

          If one of the expressions produces multiple results,
          multiple dictionaries will be produced. If the input's

              {"user":"stedolan","titles":["JQ Primer", "More JQ"]}

          then the expression

              {user, title: .titles[]}

          will produce two outputs:

              {"user":"stedolan", "title": "JQ Primer"}
              {"user":"stedolan", "title": "More JQ"}

          Putting parentheses around the key means it will be evaluated as an
          expression. With the same input as above,

              {(.user): .titles}

          produces

              {"stedolan": ["JQ Primer", "More JQ"]}

        examples:
          - program: '{user, title: .titles[]}'
            input: '{"user":"stedolan","titles":["JQ Primer", "More JQ"]}'
            output:
              - '{"user":"stedolan", "title": "JQ Primer"}'
              - '{"user":"stedolan", "title": "More JQ"}'
          - program: '{(.user): .titles}'
            input: '{"user":"stedolan","titles":["JQ Primer", "More JQ"]}'
            output: ['{"stedolan": ["JQ Primer", "More JQ"]}']

  - title: Builtin operators and functions
    body: |

      Some jq operator (for instance, `+`) do different things
      depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers,
      etc.). However, jq never does implicit type conversions. If you
      try to add a string to an object you'll get an error message and
      no result.

    entries:
      - title: Addition - `+`
        body: |

          The operator `+` takes two filters, applies them both
          to the same input, and adds the results together. What
          "adding" means depends on the types involved:

          - **Numbers** are added by normal arithmetic.

          - **Arrays** are added by being concatenated into a larger array.

          - **Strings** are added by being joined into a larger string.

          - **Objects** are added by merging, that is, inserting all
              the key-value pairs from both objects into a single
              combined object. If both objects contain a value for the
              same key, the object on the right of the `+` wins. (For
              recursive merge use the `*` operator.)

          `null` can be added to any value, and returns the other
          value unchanged.

        examples:
          - program: '.a + 1'
            input: '{"a": 7}'
            output: ['8']
          - program: '.a + .b'
            input: '{"a": [1,2], "b": [3,4]}'
            output: ['[1,2,3,4]']
          - program: '.a + null'
            input: '{"a": 1}'
            output: ['1']
          - program: '.a + 1'
            input: '{}'
            output: ['1']
          - program: '{a: 1} + {b: 2} + {c: 3} + {a: 42}'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['{"a": 42, "b": 2, "c": 3}']

      - title: Subtraction - `-`
        body: |

          As well as normal arithmetic subtraction on numbers, the `-`
          operator can be used on arrays to remove all occurences of
          the second array's elements from the first array.

        examples:
          - program: '4 - .a'
            input: '{"a":3}'
            output: ['1']
          - program: . - ["xml", "yaml"]
            input: '["xml", "yaml", "json"]'
            output: ['["json"]']

      - title: Multiplication, division, modulo - `*`, `/`, and `%`
        body: |

          These operators only work on numbers, and do the expected.

          Multiplying a string by a number produces the concatenation of
          that string that many times.

          Dividing a string by another splits the first using the second
          as separators.

          Multiplying two objects will merge them recursively: this works
          like addition but if both objects contain a value for the
          same key, and the values are objects, the two are merged with
          the same strategy.

        examples:
          - program: '10 / . * 3'
            input: 5
            output: [6]
          - program: '. / ", "'
            input: '"a, b,c,d, e"'
            output: ['["a","b,c,d","e"]']
          - program: '{"k": {"a": 1, "b": 2}} * {"k": {"a": 0,"c": 3}}'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['{"k": {"a": 0, "b": 2, "c": 3}}']


      - title: "`length`"
        body: |

          The builtin function `length` gets the length of various
          different types of value:

          - The length of a **string** is the number of Unicode
            codepoints it contains (which will be the same as its
            JSON-encoded length in bytes if it's pure ASCII).

          - The length of an **array** is the number of elements.

          - The length of an **object** is the number of key-value pairs.

          - The length of **null** is zero.

        examples:
          - program: '.[] | length'
            input: '[[1,2], "string", {"a":2}, null]'
            output: [2, 6, 1, 0]

      - title: "`keys`"
        body: |

          The builtin function `keys`, when given an object, returns
          its keys in an array.

          The keys are sorted "alphabetically", by unicode codepoint
          order. This is not an order that makes particular sense in
          any particular language, but you can count on it being the
          same for any two objects with the same set of keys,
          regardless of locale settings.

          When `keys` is given an array, it returns the valid indices
          for that array: the integers from 0 to length-1.

        examples:
          - program: 'keys'
            input: '{"abc": 1, "abcd": 2, "Foo": 3}'
            output: ['["Foo", "abc", "abcd"]']
          - program: 'keys'
            input: '[42,3,35]'
            output: ['[0,1,2]']

      - title: "`has(key)`"
        body: |

          The builtin function `has` returns whether the input object
          has the given key, or the input array has an element at the
          given index.

          `has($key)` has the same effect as checking whether `$key`
          is a member of the array returned by `keys`, although `has`
          will be faster.

        examples:
          - program: 'map(has("foo"))'
            input: '[{"foo": 42}, {}]'
            output: ['[true, false]']
          - program: 'map(has(2))'
            input: '[[0,1], ["a","b","c"]]'
            output: ['[false, true]']

      - title: "`path(path_expression)`"
        body: |

          Outputs array representations of the given path expression
          in `.`.  The outputs are arrays of strings (keys in objects0
          and/or numbers (array indices.

          Path expressions are jq expressions like `.a`, but also `.[]`.
          There are two types of path expressions: ones that can match
          exactly, and ones that cannot.  For example, `.a.b.c` is an
          exact match path expression, while `.a[].b` is not.

          `path(exact_path_expression)` will produce the array
          representation of the path expression even if it does not
          exist in `.`, if `.` is `null` or an array or an object.

          `path(pattern)` will produce array representations of the
          paths matching `pattern` if the paths exist in `.`.

          Note that the path expressions are not different from normal
          expressions.  The expression
          `path(..|select(type=="boolean"))` outputs all the paths to
          boolean values in `.`, and only those paths.

        examples:
          - program: 'path(.a[0].b)'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['["a",0,"b"]']
          - program: '[path(..)]'
            input: '{"a":[{"b":1}]}'
            output: ['[[],["a"],["a",0],["a",0,"b"]]']

      - title: "`del(path_expression)`"
        body: |

          The builtin function `del` removes a key and its corresponding
          value from an object.

        examples:
          - program: 'del(.foo)'
            input: '{"foo": 42, "bar": 9001, "baz": 42}'
            output: ['{"bar": 9001, "baz": 42}']
          - program: 'del(.[1, 2])'
            input: '["foo", "bar", "baz"]'
            output: ['["foo"]']

      - title: "`to_entries`, `from_entries`, `with_entries`"
        body: |

          These functions convert between an object and an array of
          key-value pairs. If `to_entries` is passed an object, then
          for each `k: v` entry in the input, the output array
          includes `{"key": k, "value": v}`.

          `from_entries` does the opposite conversion, and
          `with_entries(foo)` is a shorthand for `to_entries |
          map(foo) | from_entries`, useful for doing some operation to
          all keys and values of an object.

        examples:
          - program: 'to_entries'
            input: '{"a": 1, "b": 2}'
            output: ['[{"key":"a", "value":1}, {"key":"b", "value":2}]']
          - program: 'from_entries'
            input: '[{"key":"a", "value":1}, {"key":"b", "value":2}]'
            output: ['{"a": 1, "b": 2}']
          - program: 'with_entries(.key |= "KEY_" + .)'
            input: '{"a": 1, "b": 2}'
            output: ['{"KEY_a": 1, "KEY_b": 2}']


      - title: "`select(boolean_expression)`"
        body: |

          The function `select(foo)` produces its input unchanged if
          `foo` returns true for that input, and produces no output
          otherwise.

          It's useful for filtering lists: `[1,2,3] | map(select(. >= 2))`
          will give you `[2,3]`.

        examples:
          - program: 'map(select(. >= 2))'
            input: '[1,5,3,0,7]'
            output: ['[5,3,7]']
          - program: '.[] | select(.id == "second")'
            input: '[{"id": "first", "val": 1}, {"id": "second", "val": 2}]'
            output: ['{"id": "second", "val": 2}']


      - title: "`arrays`, `objects`, `iterables`, `booleans`, `numbers`, `strings`, `nulls`, `values`, `scalars`"
        body: |

          These built-ins select only inputs that are arrays, objects,
          iterables (arrays or objects), booleans, numbers, strings,
          null, non-null values, and non-iterables, respectively.

        examples:
          - program: '.[]|numbers'
            input: '[[],{},1,"foo",null,true,false]'
            output: ['1']

      - title: "`empty`"
        body: |

          `empty` returns no results. None at all. Not even `null`.

          It's useful on occasion. You'll know if you need it :)

        examples:
          - program: '1, empty, 2'
            input: 'null'
            output: [1, 2]
          - program: '[1,2,empty,3]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[1,2,3]']

      - title: "`error(message)`"
        body: |

          Produces an error, just like `.a` applied to values other than
          null and objects would, but with the given message as the
          error's value.

      - title: "`map(x)`"
        body: |

          For any filter `x`, `map(x)` will run that filter for each
          element of the input array, and produce the outputs a new
          array. `map(.+1)` will increment each element of an array of numbers.

          `map(x)` is equivalent to `[.[] | x]`. In fact, this is how
          it's defined.

        examples:
          - program: 'map(.+1)'
            input: '[1,2,3]'
            output: ['[2,3,4]']

      - title: "`paths`, `paths(node_filter)`, `leaf_paths`"
        body: |

          `paths` outputs the paths to all the elements in its input
          (except it does not output the empty list, representing .
          itself).

          `paths(f)` outputs the paths to any values for which `f` is true.
          That is, `paths(numbers)` outputs the paths to all numeric
          values.

          `leaf_paths` is an alias of `paths(scalars)`; `leaf_paths` is
          *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major release.

        examples:
          - program: '[paths]'
            input: '[1,[[],{"a":2}]]'
            output: ['[[0],[1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1,"a"]]']
          - program: '[paths(scalars)]'
            input: '[1,[[],{"a":2}]]'
            output: ['[[0],[1,1,"a"]]']

      - title: "`add`"
        body: |

          The filter `add` takes as input an array, and produces as
          output the elements of the array added together. This might
          mean summed, concatenated or merged depending on the types
          of the elements of the input array - the rules are the same
          as those for the `+` operator (described above).

          If the input is an empty array, `add` returns `null`.

        examples:
          - program: add
            input: '["a","b","c"]'
            output: ['"abc"']
          - program: add
            input: '[1, 2, 3]'
            output: [6]
          - program: add
            input: '[]'
            output: ["null"]

      - title: "`any`, `any(condition)`, `any(generator; condition)`"
        body: |

          The filter `any` takes as input an array of boolean values,
          and produces `true` as output if any of the the elements of
          the array is `true`.

          If the input is an empty array, `any` returns `false`.

          The `any(condition)` form applies the given condition to the
          elements of the input array.

          The `any(generator; condition)` form applies the given
          condition to all the outputs of the given generator.

        examples:
          - program: any
            input: '[true, false]'
            output: ["true"]
          - program: any
            input: '[false, false]'
            output: ["false"]
          - program: any
            input: '[]'
            output: ["false"]

      - title: "`all`, `all(condition)`, `all(generator; condition)`"
        body: |

          The filter `all` takes as input an array of boolean values,
          and produces `true` as output if all of the the elements of
          the array are `true`.

          The `all(condition)` form applies the given condition to the
          elements of the input array.

          The `all(generator; condition)` form applies the given
          condition to all the outputs of the given generator.

          If the input is an empty array, `all` returns `true`.

        examples:
          - program: all
            input: '[true, false]'
            output: ["false"]
          - program: all
            input: '[true, true]'
            output: ["true"]
          - program: all
            input: '[]'
            output: ["true"]

      - title: "`flatten`, `flatten(depth)`"
        body: |

          The filter `flatten` takes as input an array of nested arrays,
          and produces a flat array in which all arrays inside the original
          array have been recursively replaced by their values. You can pass
          an argument to it to specify how many levels of nesting to flatten.

          `flatten(2)` is like `flatten`, but going only up to two
          levels deep.

        examples:
          - program: flatten
            input: '[1, [2], [[3]]]'
            output: ["[1, 2, 3]"]
          - program: flatten(1)
            input: '[1, [2], [[3]]]'
            output: ["[1, 2, [3]]"]
          - program: flatten
            input: '[[]]'
            output: ["[]"]
          - program: flatten
            input: '[{"foo": "bar"}, [{"foo": "baz"}]]'
            output: ['[{"foo": "bar"}, {"foo": "baz"}]']

      - title: "`range(upto)`, `range(from;upto)` `range(from;upto;by)`"
        body: |

          The `range` function produces a range of numbers. `range(4;10)`
          produces 6 numbers, from 4 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive). The numbers
          are produced as separate outputs. Use `[range(4;10)]` to get a range as
          an array.

          The one argument form generates numbers from 0 to the given
          number, with an increment of 1.

          The two argument form generates numbers from `from` to `upto`
          with an increment of 1.

          The three argument form generates numbers `from` to `upto`
          with an increment of `by`.

        examples:
          - program: 'range(2;4)'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['2', '3']
          - program: '[range(2;4)]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[2,3]']
          - program: '[range(4)]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[0,1,2,3]']
          - program: '[range(0;10;3)]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[0,3,6,9]']
          - program: '[range(0;10;-1)]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[]']
          - program: '[range(0;-5;-1)]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[0,-1,-2,-3,-4]']

      - title: "`floor`"
        body: |

          The `floor` function returns the floor of its numeric input.

        examples:
          - program: 'floor'
            input: '3.14159'
            output: ['3']

      - title: "`sqrt`"
        body: |

          The `sqrt` function returns the square root of its numeric input.

        examples:
          - program: 'sqrt'
            input: '9'
            output: ['3']

      - title: "`tonumber`"
        body: |

          The `tonumber` function parses its input as a number. It
          will convert correctly-formatted strings to their numeric
          equivalent, leave numbers alone, and give an error on all other input.

        examples:
          - program: '.[] | tonumber'
            input: '[1, "1"]'
            output: [1, 1]

      - title: "`tostring`"
        body: |

          The `tostring` function prints its input as a
          string. Strings are left unchanged, and all other values are
          JSON-encoded.

        examples:
          - program: '.[] | tostring'
            input: '[1, "1", [1]]'
            output: ['"1"', '"1"', '"[1]"']

      - title: "`type`"
        body: |

          The `type` function returns the type of its argument as a
          string, which is one of null, boolean, number, string, array
          or object.

        examples:
          - program: 'map(type)'
            input: '[0, false, [], {}, null, "hello"]'
            output: ['["number", "boolean", "array", "object", "null", "string"]']

      - title: "`sort, sort(path_expression), sort_by(path_expression)`"
        body: |

          The `sort` functions sorts its input, which must be an
          array. Values are sorted in the following order:

          * `null`
          * `false`
          * `true`
          * numbers
          * strings, in alphabetical order (by unicode codepoint value)
          * arrays, in lexical order
          * objects

          The ordering for objects is a little complex: first they're
          compared by comparing their sets of keys (as arrays in
          sorted order), and if their keys are equal then the values
          are compared key by key.

          `sort` may be used to sort by a particular field of an
          object, or by applying any jq filter.

          `sort(foo)` compares two elements by comparing the result of
          `foo` on each element.

          `sort_by(foo)` is an alias of `sort(foo)`; `sort_by()` is
          *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major release.

        examples:
          - program: 'sort'
            input: '[8,3,null,6]'
            output: ['[null,3,6,8]']
          - program: 'sort(.foo)'
            input: '[{"foo":4, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":2, "bar":1}]'
            output: ['[{"foo":2, "bar":1}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":4, "bar":10}]']

      - title: "`group(path_expression)`, `group_by(path_expression)`"
        body: |

          `group(.foo)` takes as input an array, groups the
          elements having the same `.foo` field into separate arrays,
          and produces all of these arrays as elements of a larger
          array, sorted by the value of the `.foo` field.

          Any jq expression, not just a field access, may be used in
          place of `.foo`. The sorting order is the same as described
          in the `sort` function above.

          `group_by(foo)` is an alias of `group(foo)`; `group_by()` is
          *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major release.

        examples:
          - program: 'group(.foo)'
            input: '[{"foo":1, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":1, "bar":1}]'
            output: ['[[{"foo":1, "bar":10}, {"foo":1, "bar":1}], [{"foo":3, "bar":100}]]']

      - title: "`min`, `max`, `min(path_exp)`, `max(path_exp)`, `min_by(path_exp)`, `max_by(path_exp)`"
        body: |

          Find the minimum or maximum element of the input array.
          This filter accepts an optional argument that
          allows you to specify a particular field or
          property to examine, e.g. `min(.foo)` finds the object
          with the smallest `foo` field.

          For legacy reasons, `min_by(.foo)` and `max_by(.foo)` exist as
          aliases for `min(.foo)` and `max(.foo)`. These aliases are
          considered *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major
          release.

        examples:
          - program: 'min'
            input: '[5,4,2,7]'
            output: ['2']
          - program: 'max(.foo)'
            input: '[{"foo":1, "bar":14}, {"foo":2, "bar":3}]'
            output: ['{"foo":2, "bar":3}']

      - title: "`unique`, `unique(path_exp)`, `unique_by(path_exp)`"
        body: |

          The `unique` function takes as input an array and produces
          an array of the same elements, in sorted order, with
          duplicates removed. If an optional argument is passed, it
          will keep only one element for each value obtained by applying
          the argument. Think of it as making an array by taking one
          element out of every group produced by `group`.

          For legacy reasons, `unique_by(.foo)` exists as an alias for
          `unique(.foo)`. This alias is considered *deprecated* and will
          be removed in the next major release.

        examples:
          - program: 'unique'
            input: '[1,2,5,3,5,3,1,3]'
            output: ['[1,2,3,5]']
          - program: 'unique(.foo)'
            input: '[{"foo": 1, "bar": 2}, {"foo": 1, "bar": 3}, {"foo": 4, "bar": 5}]'
            output: ['[{"foo": 1, "bar": 2}, {"foo": 4, "bar": 5}]']
          - program: 'unique(length)'
            input: '["chunky", "bacon", "kitten", "cicada", "asparagus"]'
            output: ['["chunky", "bacon", "asparagus"]']

      - title: "`reverse`"
        body: |

          This function reverses an array.

        examples:
          - program: 'reverse'
            input: '[1,2,3,4]'
            output: ['[4,3,2,1]']

      - title: "`contains(element)`"
        body: |

          The filter `contains(b)` will produce true if b is
          completely contained within the input. A string B is
          contained in a string A if B is a substring of A. An array B
          is contained in an array A is all elements in B are
          contained in any element in A. An object B is contained in
          object A if all of the values in B are contained in the
          value in A with the same key. All other types are assumed to
          be contained in each other if they are equal.

        examples:
          - program: 'contains("bar")'
            input: '"foobar"'
            output: ['true']
          - program: 'contains(["baz", "bar"])'
            input: '["foobar", "foobaz", "blarp"]'
            output: ['true']
          - program: 'contains(["bazzzzz", "bar"])'
            input: '["foobar", "foobaz", "blarp"]'
            output: ['false']
          - program: 'contains({foo: 12, bar: [{barp: 12}]})'
            input: '{"foo": 12, "bar":[1,2,{"barp":12, "blip":13}]}'
            output: ['true']
          - program: 'contains({foo: 12, bar: [{barp: 15}]})'
            input: '{"foo": 12, "bar":[1,2,{"barp":12, "blip":13}]}'
            output: ['false']

      - title: "`indices(s)`"
        body: |

          Outputs an array containing the indices in `.` where `s`
          occurs.  The input may be an array, in which case if `s` is an
          array then the indices output will be those where all elements
          in `.` match those of `s`.

        examples:
          - program: 'indices(", ")'
            input: '"a,b, cd, efg, hijk"'
            output: ['[3,7,12]']
          - program: 'indices(1)'
            input: '[0,1,2,1,3,1,4]'
            output: ['[1,3,5]']
          - program: 'indices([1,2])'
            input: '[0,1,2,3,1,4,2,5,1,2,6,7]'
            output: ['[1,8]']

      - title: "`index(s)`, `rindex(s)`"
        body: |

          Outputs the index of the first (`index`) or last (`rindex`)
          occurrence of `s` in the input.

        examples:
          - program: 'index(", ")'
            input: '"a,b, cd, efg, hijk"'
            output: ['3']
          - program: 'rindex(", ")]'
            input: '"a,b, cd, efg, hijk"'
            output: ['12']

      - title: "`startswith(str)`"
        body: |

          Outputs `true` if . starts with the given string argument.

        examples:
          - program: '[.[]|startswith("foo")]'
            input: '["fo", "foo", "barfoo", "foobar", "barfoob"]'
            output: ['[false, true, false, true, false]']

      - title: "`endswith(str)`"
        body: |

          Outputs `true` if . ends with the given string argument.

        examples:
          - program: '[.[]|endswith("foo")]'
            input: '["foobar", "barfoo"]'
            output: ['[false, true]']

      - title: "`ltrimstr(str)`"
        body: |

          Outputs its input with the given prefix string removed, if it
          starts with it.

        examples:
          - program: '[.[]|ltrimstr("foo")]'
            input: '["fo", "foo", "barfoo", "foobar", "afoo"]'
            output: ['["fo","","barfoo","bar","afoo"]']

      - title: "`rtrimstr(str)`"
        body: |

          Outputs its input with the given suffix string removed, if it
          starts with it.

        examples:
          - program: '[.[]|rtrimstr("foo")]'
            input: '["fo", "foo", "barfoo", "foobar", "foob"]'
            output: ['["fo","","bar","foobar","foob"]']

      - title: "`explode`"
        body: |

          Converts an input string into an array of the string's
          codepoint numbers.

        examples:
          - program: 'explode'
            input: '"foobar"'
            output: ['[102,111,111,98,97,114]']

      - title: "`implode`"
        body: |

          The inverse of explode.

        examples:
          - program: 'implode'
            input: '[65, 66, 67]'
            output: ['"ABC"']

      - title: "`split`"
        body: |

          Splits an input string on the separator argument.

        examples:
          - program: 'split(", ")'
            input: '"a, b,c,d, e"'
            output: ['["a","b,c,d","e"]']

      - title: "`join(str)`"
        body: |

          Joins the array of elements given as input, using the
          argument as separator. It is the inverse of `split`: that is,
          running `split("foo") | join("foo")` over any input string
          returns said input string.

        examples:
          - program: 'join(", ")'
            input: '["a","b,c,d","e"]'
            output: ['"a, b,c,d, e"']

      - title: "`while(cond; update)`"
        body: |

          The `while(cond; update)` function allows you to repeatedly
          apply an update to `.` until `cond` is false.

          Note that `while(cond; update)` is internally defined as a
          recursive jq function.  Recursive calls within `while` will
          not consume additional memory if `update` produces at most one
          output for each input.  See advanced topics below.

        examples:
          - program: '[while(.<100; .*2)]'
            input: '1'
            output: ['[1,2,4,8,16,32,64]']


      - title: "`recurse(f)`, `recurse`, `recurse(f; condition)`, `recurse_down`"
        body: |

          The `recurse(f)` function allows you to search through a
          recursive structure, and extract interesting data from all
          levels. Suppose your input represents a filesystem:

              {"name": "/", "children": [
                {"name": "/bin", "children": [
                  {"name": "/bin/ls", "children": []},
                  {"name": "/bin/sh", "children": []}]},
                {"name": "/home", "children": [
                  {"name": "/home/stephen", "children": [
                    {"name": "/home/stephen/jq", "children": []}]}]}]}

          Now suppose you want to extract all of the filenames
          present. You need to retrieve `.name`, `.children[].name`,
          `.children[].children[].name`, and so on. You can do this
          with:

              recurse(.children[]) | .name

          When called without an argument, `recurse` is equivalent to
          `recurse(.[]?)`.

          `recurse(f)` is identical to `recurse(f; . != null)` and can be
          used without concerns about recursion depth.

          `recurse(f; condition)` is a generator which begins by
          emitting . and then emits in turn .|f, .|f|f, .|f|f|f, ...  so long
          as the computed value satisfies the condition. For example,
          to generate all the integers, at least in principle, one
          could write `recurse(.+1; true)`.

          For legacy reasons, `recurse_down` exists as an alias to
          calling `recurse` without arguments. This alias is considered
          *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major release.

          The recursive calls in `recurse` will not consume additional
          memory whenever `f` produces at most a single output for each
          input.

        examples:
          - program: 'recurse(.foo[])'
            input: '{"foo":[{"foo": []}, {"foo":[{"foo":[]}]}]}'
            output:
              - '{"foo":[{"foo":[]},{"foo":[{"foo":[]}]}]}'
              - '{"foo":[]}'
              - '{"foo":[{"foo":[]}]}'
              - '{"foo":[]}'

          - program: 'recurse'
            input: '{"a":0,"b":[1]}'
            output:
              - '0'
              - '[1]'
              - '1'

          - program: 'recurse(. * .; . < 20)'
            input: 2
            output:
                - 2
                - 4
                - 16

      - title: "`..`"
        body: |

          Short-hand for `recurse` without arguments.  This is intended
          to resemble the XPath `//` operator.  Note that `..a` does not
          work; use `..|a` instead.  In the example below we use
          `..|.a?` to find all the values of object keys "a" in any
          object found "below" `.`.

        examples:
          - program: '..|.a?'
            input: '[[{"a":1}]]'
            output: ['1']

      - title: "`env`"
        body: |

          Outputs an object representing jq's environment.

        examples:
          - program: 'env.PAGER'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['"less"']

      - title: "String interpolation - `\\(foo)`"
        body: |

          Inside a string, you can put an expression inside parens
          after a backslash. Whatever the expression returns will be
          interpolated into the string.

        examples:
          - program: '"The input was \(.), which is one less than \(.+1)"'
            input: '42'
            output: ['"The input was 42, which is one less than 43"']

      - title: "Convert to/from JSON"
        body: |

          The `tojson` and `fromjson` builtins dump values as JSON texts
          or parse JSON texts into values, respectively.  The tojson
          builtin differs from tostring in that tostring returns strings
          unmodified, while tojson encodes strings as JSON strings.

        examples:
          - program: '[.[]|tostring]'
            input: '[1, "foo", ["foo"]]'
            output: ['["1","foo","[\"foo\"]"]']
          - program: '[.[]|tojson]'
            input: '[1, "foo", ["foo"]]'
            output: ['["1","\"foo\"","[\"foo\"]"]']
          - program: '[.[]|tojson|fromjson]'
            input: '[1, "foo", ["foo"]]'
            output: ['[1,"foo",["foo"]]']

      - title: "Format strings and escaping"
        body: |

          The `@foo` syntax is used to format and escape strings,
          which is useful for building URLs, documents in a language
          like HTML or XML, and so forth. `@foo` can be used as a
          filter on its own, the possible escapings are:

          * `@text`:

            Calls `tostring`, see that function for details.

          * `@json`:

            Serialises the input as JSON.

          * `@html`:

            Applies HTML/XML escaping, by mapping the characters
            `<>&'"` to their entity equivalents `&lt;`, `&gt;`,
            `&amp;`, `&apos;`, `&quot;`.

          * `@uri`:

            Applies percent-encoding, by mapping all reserved URI
            characters to a `%XX` sequence.

          * `@csv`:

            The input must be an array, and it is rendered as CSV
            with double quotes for strings, and quotes escaped by
            repetition.

          * `@sh`:

            The input is escaped suitable for use in a command-line
            for a POSIX shell. If the input is an array, the output
            will be a series of space-separated strings.

          * `@base64`:

            The input is converted to base64 as specified by RFC 4648.

          This syntax can be combined with string interpolation in a
          useful way. You can follow a `@foo` token with a string
          literal. The contents of the string literal will *not* be
          escaped. However, all interpolations made inside that string
          literal will be escaped. For instance,

              @uri "http://www.google.com/search?q=\(.search)"

          will produce the following output for the input
          `{"search":"what is jq?"}`:

              "http://www.google.com/search?q=what%20is%20jq%3F"

          Note that the slashes, question mark, etc. in the URL are
          not escaped, as they were part of the string literal.

        examples:
          - program: '@html'
            input: '"This works if x < y"'
            output: ['"This works if x &lt; y"']

#          - program: '@html "<span>Anonymous said: \(.)</span>"'
#            input: '"<script>alert(\"lol hax\");</script>"'
#            output: ["<span>Anonymous said: &lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;lol hax&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;</span>"]

          - program: '@sh "echo \(.)"'
            input: "\"O'Hara's Ale\""
            output: ["\"echo 'O'\\\\''Hara'\\\\''s Ale'\""]

  - title: Conditionals and Comparisons
    entries:
      - title: "`==`, `!=`"
        body: |

          The expression 'a == b' will produce 'true' if the result of a and b
          are equal (that is, if they represent equivalent JSON documents) and
          'false' otherwise. In particular, strings are never considered equal
          to numbers. If you're coming from Javascript, jq's == is like
          Javascript's === - considering values equal only when they have the
          same type as well as the same value.

          != is "not equal", and 'a != b' returns the opposite value of 'a == b'

        examples:
          - program: '.[] == 1'
            input: '[1, 1.0, "1", "banana"]'
            output: ['true', 'true', 'false', 'false']

      - title: if-then-else
        body: |

          `if A then B else C end` will act the same as `B` if `A`
          produces a value other than false or null, but act the same
          as `C` otherwise.

          Checking for false or null is a simpler notion of
          "truthiness" than is found in Javascript or Python, but it
          means that you'll sometimes have to be more explicit about
          the condition you want: you can't test whether, e.g. a
          string is empty using `if .name then A else B end`, you'll
          need something more like `if (.name | length) > 0 then A else
          B end` instead.

          If the condition A produces multiple results, it is
          considered "true" if any of those results is not false or
          null. If it produces zero results, it's considered false.

          More cases can be added to an if using `elif A then B` syntax.

        examples:
          - program: |-
              if . == 0 then
                "zero"
              elif . == 1 then
                "one"
              else
                "many"
              end
            input: 2
            output: ['"many"']

      - title: "`>, >=, <=, <`"
        body: |

          The comparison operators `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `<` return whether
          their left argument is greater than, greater than or equal
          to, less than or equal to or less than their right argument
          (respectively).

          The ordering is the same as that described for `sort`, above.

        examples:
          - program: '. < 5'
            input: 2
            output: ['true']

      - title: and/or/not
        body: |

          jq supports the normal Boolean operators and/or/not. They have the
          same standard of truth as if expressions - false and null are
          considered "false values", and anything else is a "true value".

          If an operand of one of these operators produces multiple
          results, the operator itself will produce a result for each input.

          `not` is in fact a builtin function rather than an operator,
          so it is called as a filter to which things can be piped
          rather than with special syntax, as in `.foo and .bar |
          not`.

          These three only produce the values "true" and "false", and
          so are only useful for genuine Boolean operations, rather
          than the common Perl/Python/Ruby idiom of
          "value_that_may_be_null or default". If you want to use this
          form of "or", picking between two values rather than
          evaluating a condition, see the "//" operator below.

        examples:
          - program: '42 and "a string"'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['true']
          - program: '(true, false) or false'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['true', 'false']
#          - program: '(true, false) and (true, false)'
#            input: 'null'
#            output: ['true', 'false', 'false', 'false']
          - program: '(true, true) and (true, false)'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['true', 'false', 'true', 'false']
          - program: '[true, false | not]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[false, true]']

      - title: Alternative operator - `//`
        body: |

          A filter of the form `a // b` produces the same
          results as `a`, if `a` produces results other than `false`
          and `null`. Otherwise, `a // b` produces the same results as `b`.

          This is useful for providing defaults: `.foo // 1` will
          evaluate to `1` if there's no `.foo` element in the
          input. It's similar to how `or` is sometimes used in Python
          (jq's `or` operator is reserved for strictly Boolean
          operations).

        examples:
          - program: '.foo // 42'
            input: '{"foo": 19}'
            output: [19]
          - program: '.foo // 42'
            input: '{}'
            output: [42]

      - title: try-catch
        body: |

          Errors can be caught by using `try EXP catch EXP`.  The first
          expression is executed, and if it fails then the second is
          executed with the error message.  The output of the handler,
          if any, is output as if it had been the output of the
          expression to try.

          The `try EXP` form uses `empty` as the exception handler.

        examples:
          - program: 'try .a catch ". is not an object"'
            input: 'true'
            output: [". is not an object"]
          - program: '[.[]|try .a]'
            input: '[{}, true, {"a":1}'
            output: ['[null, 1]']
          - program: 'try error("some exception") catch .'
            input: 'true'
            output: ['"some exception"']

      - title: "`?` operator"
        body: |

          The `?` operator, used as `EXP?`, is shorthand for `try EXP`.

        examples:
          - program: '[.[]|(.a)?]'
            input: '[{}, true, {"a":1}'
            output: ['[null, 1]']


  - title: Regular expressions (PCRE)
    body: |

      jq uses the Oniguruma regular expression library, as do php,
      ruby, TextMate, Sublime Text, etc, so the description here
      will focus on jq specifics.

      The jq regex filters are defined so that they can be used using
      one of these patterns:

              STRING | FILTER( REGEX )
              STRING | FILTER( REGEX; FLAGS )
              STRING | FILTER( [REGEX] )
              STRING | FILTER( [REGEX, FLAGS] )

          where:
           * STRING, REGEX and FLAGS are jq strings and subject to jq string interpolation;
           * REGEX, after string interpolation, should be a valid PCRE regex;
           * FILTER is one of `test`, `match`, or `capture`, as described below.

          FLAGS is a string consisting of one of more of the supported flags:

          * `g` - Global search (find all matches, not just the first)
          * `i` - Case insensitive search
          * `m` - Multi line mode ('.' will match newlines)
          * `n` - Ignore empty matches
          * `p` - Both s and m modes are enabled
          * `s` - Single line mode ('^' -> '\A', '$' -> '\Z')
          * `l` - Find longest possible matches
          * `x` - Extended regex format (ignore whitespace and comments)

          To match whitespace in an x pattern use an escape such as \s, e.g.

          * test( "a\\sb", "x" ).

          Note that certain flags may also be specified within REGEX, e.g.

          * jq -n '("test", "TEst", "teST", "TEST") | test( "(?i)te(?-i)st" )'

          evaluates to: true, true, false, false.

      entries:
        - title: "`test(val)`, `test(regex; flags)`"
            body: |

             Like `match`, but does not return match objects, only `true` or `false`
             for whether or not the regex matches the input.

            examples:
            - program: 'test("foo")'
              input: '"foo"'
              output: 'true'
            - program: 'test("a b c # spaces are ignored"; "ix")'
              input: '"xabcd" "ABC"'
              output: true
                      true

          - title: "`match(val)`, `match(regex; flags)`"
            body: |

            **match** outputs an object for each match it finds.  Matches have
            the following fields:

            * `offset` - offset in UTF-8 codepoints from the beginning of the input
            * `length` - length in UTF-8 codepoints of the match
            * `string` - the string that it matched
            * `captures` - an array of objects representing capturing groups.

            Capturing group objects have the following fields:

            * `offset` - offset in UTF-8 codepoints from the beginning of the input
            * `length` - length in UTF-8 codepoints of this capturing group
            * `string` - the string that was captured
            * `name` - the name of the capturing group (or `null` if it was unnamed)

            Capturing groups that did not match anything return an offset of -1

            examples:
            - program: 'match("(abc)+"; "g")'
              input: '"abc abc"'
              output:
               - '{"offset": 0, "length": 3, "string": "abc", "captures": [{"offset": 0, "length": 3, "string": "abc", "name": null}]}'
               - '{"offset": 4, "length": 3, "string": "abc", "captures": [{"offset": 4, "length": 3, "string": "abc", "name": null}]}'
            - program: 'match("foo")'
              input: '"foo bar foo"'
              output: ['{"offset": 0, "length": 3, "string": "foo", "captures": []}']
            - program: 'match(["foo", "ig"])'
              input: '"foo bar FOO"'
              output:
               - '{"offset": 0, "length": 3, "string": "foo", "captures": []}'
               - '{"offset": 8, "length": 3, "string": "FOO", "captures": []}'
            - program: 'match("foo (?<bar123>bar)? foo"; "ig")'
              input: '"foo bar foo foo  foo"'
              output:
               - '{"offset": 0, "length": 11, "string": "foo bar foo", "captures": [{"offset": 4, "length": 3, "string": "bar", "name": "bar123"}]}'
               - '{"offset": 12, "length": 8, "string": "foo  foo", "captures": [{"offset": -1, "length": 0, "string": null, "name": "bar123"}]}'

            - program: '[ match("."; "g")] | length'
              input: '"abc"'
              output: 3


          - title: "`capture(val)`, `capture(regex; flags)`"
            body: |

             Collects the named captures in a JSON object, with the name
             of each capture as the key, and the matched string as the
             corresponding value.

            examples:
            - program: 'capture("(?<a>[a-z]+)-(?<n>[0-9]+)")'
              input: '"xyzzy-14"'
              output: ['{ "a": "xyzzy", "n": "14" }']

  - title: "`scan(regex)`, `scan(regex; flags)`"
    body: |

      Emit a stream of the non-overlapping substrings of the input
      that match the regex in accordance with the flags, if any
      have been specified.  If there is no match, the stream is empty.
      To capture all the matches for each input string, use the idiom
      `[ expr ]`, e.g. `[ scan(regex) ]`.

    example:
    - program: 'scan("c")'
      input: '"abcdefabc"'
      output: ['"c"', '"c"']

    - program: 'scan("b")'
      input: ("", "")
      output: ['[]', '[]']

  - title: "`split(regex)`, `split(regex; flags)`"
    body: |

      For backwards compatibility, `split` emits an array of the strings
      corresponding to the successive segments of the input string after it
      has been split at the boundaries defined by the regex and any
      specified flags.  The substrings corresponding to the boundaries
      themselves are excluded.  If regex is the empty string, then the first
      match will be the empty string.

      `split(regex)` can be thought of as a wrapper around `splits(regex)`,
      and similarly for `split(regex; flags)`.

    example:
    - program: 'split(", *")'
      input: '"ab,cd, ef"'
      output: ['"ab","cd","ef"']


  - title: "`splits(regex)`, splits(regex; flags)`"
    body: |

      These provide the same results as their `split` counterparts,
      but as a stream instead of an array.

    example:
    - program: 'splits(", *")'
      input: '("ab,cd", "ef, gh")'
      output: ['"ab"', '"cd"', '"ef"', '"gh"']

  - title: "`sub(regex; tostring)`"
    body: |

      Emit the string obtained by replacing the first match of regex in the
      input string with `tostring`, after interpolation.  `tostring` should
      be a jq string, and may contain references to named captures. The
      named captures are, in effect, presented as a JSON object (as
      constructed by `capture`) to `tostring`, so a reference to a captured
      variable named "x" would take the form: "\(.x)".

    example:
    - program: 'sub("^[^a-z]*(?<x>[a-z]*).*")'
      input: '"123abc456"'
      output: '"ZabcZabc"'


  - title: "`gsub(regex; string)`"
    body: |

      `gsub` is like `sub` but all the non-overlapping occurrences of the regex are
      replaced by the string, after interpolation.

    example:
    - program: 'gsub("(?<x>.)[^a]*"; "+\(.x)-")'
      input: '"Abcabc"'
      output: '"+A-+a-"'


  - title: Advanced features
    body: |
      Variables are an absolute necessity in most programming languages, but
      they're relegated to an "advanced feature" in jq.

      In most languages, variables are the only means of passing around
      data. If you calculate a value, and you want to use it more than once,
      you'll need to store it in a variable. To pass a value to another part
      of the program, you'll need that part of the program to define a
      variable (as a function parameter, object member, or whatever) in
      which to place the data.

      It is also possible to define functions in jq, although this is
      is a feature whose biggest use is defining jq's standard library
      (many jq functions such as `map` and `find` are in fact written
      in jq).

      Finally, jq has a `reduce` operation, which is very powerful but a
      bit tricky. Again, it's mostly used internally, to define some
      useful bits of jq's standard library.

    entries:
      - title: Variables
        body: |

          In jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual
          plumbing is not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program
          to the next. Many expressions, for instance `a + b`, pass their input
          to two distinct subexpressions (here `a` and `b` are both passed the
          same input), so variables aren't usually necessary in order to use a
          value twice.

          For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers
          requires a few variables in most languages - at least one to hold the
          array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter. In jq, it's
          simply `add / length` - the `add` expression is given the array and
          produces its sum, and the `length` expression is given the array and
          produces its length.

          So, there's generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jq than
          defining variables. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jq
          lets you define variables using `expression as $variable`. All
          variable names start with `$`. Here's a slightly uglier version of the
          array-averaging example:

              length as $array_length | add / $array_length

          We'll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where using
          variables actually makes our lives easier.


          Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with "author" and "title"
          fields, and another object which is used to map author usernames to
          real names. Our input looks like:

              {"posts": [{"title": "Frist psot", "author": "anon"},
                         {"title": "A well-written article", "author": "person1"}],
               "realnames": {"anon": "Anonymous Coward",
                             "person1": "Person McPherson"}}

          We want to produce the posts with the author field containing a real
          name, as in:

              {"title": "Frist psot", "author": "Anonymous Coward"}
              {"title": "A well-written article", "author": "Person McPherson"}

          We use a variable, $names, to store the realnames object, so that we
          can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:

              .realnames as $names | .posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]}

          The expression `exp as $x | ...` means: for each value of expression
          `exp`, run the rest of the pipeline with the entire original input, and
          with `$x` set to that value.  Thus `as` functions as something of a
          foreach loop.

          Variables are scoped over the rest of the expression that defines
          them, so

              .realnames as $names | (.posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]})

          will work, but

              (.realnames as $names | .posts[]) | {title, author: $names[.author]}

          won't.

          For programming language theorists, it's more accurate to
          say that jq variables are lexically-scoped bindings.  In
          particular there's no way to change the value of a binding;
          one can only setup a new binding with the same name, but which
          will not be visible where the old one was.

        examples:
          - program: '.bar as $x | .foo | . + $x'
            input: '{"foo":10, "bar":200}'
            output: ['210']
          - program: '. as $i|[(.*2|. as $i| $i), $i]'
            input: '5'
            output: ['[10,5]']

      - title: 'Defining Functions'
        body: |

          You can give a filter a name using "def" syntax:

              def increment: . + 1;

          From then on, `increment` is usable as a filter just like a
          builtin function (in fact, this is how some of the builtins
          are defined). A function may take arguments:

              def map(f): [.[] | f];

          Arguments are passed as filters, not as values. The
          same argument may be referenced multiple times with
          different inputs (here `f` is run for each element of the
          input array). Arguments to a function work more like
          callbacks than like value arguments.  This is important to
          understand.  Consider:

              def foo(f): f|f;
              5|foo(.*2)

          The result will be 20 because `f` is `.*2`, and during the
          first invocation of `f` `.` will be 5, and the second time it
          will be 10 (5 * 2), so the result will be 20.  Function
          arguments are filters, and filters expect an input when
          invoked.

          If you want the value-argument behaviour for defining simple
          functions, you can just use a variable:

              def addvalue(f): f as $f | map(. + $f);

          Or use the short-hand:

              def addvalue($f): ...;

          With either definition, `addvalue(.foo)` will add the current
          input's `.foo` field to each element of the array.

          Multiple definitions using the same function name are allowed.
          Each re-definition replaces the previous one for the same
          number of function arguments, but only for references from
          functions (or main program) subsequent to the re-definition.

        examples:
          - program: 'def addvalue(f): . + [f]; map(addvalue(.[0]))'
            input: '[[1,2],[10,20]]'
            output: ['[[1,2,1], [10,20,10]]']
          - program: 'def addvalue(f): f as $x | map(. + $x); addvalue(.[0])'
            input: '[[1,2],[10,20]]'
            output: ['[[1,2,1,2], [10,20,1,2]]']

      - title: Reduce
        body: |

          The `reduce` syntax in jq allows you to combine all of the
          results of an expression by accumulating them into a single
          answer. As an example, we'll pass `[3,2,1]` to this expression:

              reduce .[] as $item (0; . + $item)

          For each result that `.[]` produces, `. + $item` is run to
          accumulate a running total, starting from 0. In this
          example, `.[]` produces the results 3, 2, and 1, so the
          effect is similar to running something like this:

              0 | (3 as $item | . + $item) |
                  (2 as $item | . + $item) |
                  (1 as $item | . + $item)

        examples:
          - program: 'reduce .[] as $item (0; . + $item)'
            input: '[10,2,5,3]'
            output: ['20']

      - title: "`limit(n; exp)`"
        body: |

          The `limit` function extracts up to `n` outputs from `exp`.

        examples:
          - program: '[limit(3;.[])]'
            input: '[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]'
            output: ['[0,1,2]']

      - title: "`first(expr)`, `last(expr)`, `nth(n; expr)`"
        body: |

          The `first(expr)` and `last(expr)` functions extract the first
          and last values from `expr`, respectively.

          The `nth(n; expr)` function extracts the nth value output by
          `expr`.  This can be defined as `def nth(n; expr):
          last(limit(n + 1; expr));`.  Note that `nth(n; expr)` doesn't
          support negative values of `n`.

        examples:
          - program: '[first(range(.)), last(range(.)), nth(./2; range(.))]'
            input: '10'
            output: ['[0,9,4]']

      - title: "`first`, `last`, `nth(n)`"
        body: |

          The `first` and `last` functions extract the first
          and last values from any array at `.`.

          The `nth(n)` function extracts the nth value of any array at `.`.

        examples:
          - program: '[range(.)]|[first, last, nth(5)]'
            input: '10'
            output: ['[0,9,5]']

      - title: "`foreach`"
        body: |

          The `foreach` syntax is similar to `reduce`, but intended to
          allow the construction of `limit` and reducers that produce
          intermediate results (see example).

          The form is `foreach EXP as $var (INIT; UPDATE; EXTRACT)`.
          Like `reduce`, `INIT` is evaluated once to produce a state
          value, then each output of `EXP` is bound to `$var`, `UPDATE`
          is evaluated for each output of `EXP` with the current state
          and with `$var` visible.  Each value output by `UPDATE`
          replaces the previous state.  Finally, `EXTRACT` is evaluated
          for each new state to extract an output of `foreach`.

          This is mostly useful only for constructing `reduce`- and
          `limit`-like functions.  But it is much more general, as it
          allows for partial reductions (see the example below), as well
          as breaking out of the "loop" with `break`.

        examples:
          - program: '[foreach .[] as $item
                        ([[],[]];
                        if $item == null then [[],.[0]] else [(.[0] + [$item]),[]] end;
                        if $item == null then .[1] else empty end)]'
            input: '[1,2,3,4,null,"a","b",null]'
            output: ['[[1,2,3,4],["a","b"]]']

      - title: Recursion
        body: |

          As described above, `recurse` uses recursion, and any jq
          function can be recursive.  The `while` builtin is also
          implemented in terms of recursion.

          Tail calls are optmized whenever the expression to the left of
          the recursive call outputs its last value.  In practice this
          means that the expression to the left of the recursive call
          should not produce more than one output for each input.

          For example:

              def recurse(f): def r: ., (f | select(. != null) | r); r;

              def while(cond; update):
                def w: if cond then ., (update | _while) else empty end;
                try _while catch if . == "break" then empty else . end;

      - title: Generators and iterators
        body: |

            Some jq operators and functions are actually generators in
            that they can produce zero, one, or more values for each
            input, just as one might expect in other programming
            languages that have generators.  For example, `.[]`
            generates all the values in its input (which must be an
            array or an object), `range(0; 10)` generates the integers
            between 0 and 10, and so on.

            Even the comma operator is a generator, generating first the
            values generated by the expression to the left of the comma,
            then for each of those, the values generate by the
            expression on the right of the comma.

            The `empty` builtin is the generator that produces zero
            outputs.  The `empty` builtin backtracks to the preceding
            generator expression.

            All jq functions can be generators just by using builtin
            generators.  It is also possible to define new generators
            using only recursion and the comma operator.  If the
            recursive call(s) is(are) "in tail position" then the
            generator will be efficient.  In the example below the
            recursive call by `_range` to itself is in tail position.
            The example shows off three advanced topics: tail recursion,
            generator construction, and sub-functions.

        examples:
          - program: 'def range(init; upto; by):
                    def _range:
                        if (by > 0 and . < upto) or (by < 0 and . > upto)
                        then ., ((.+by)|_range)
                        else . end;
                    if by == 0 then init else init|_range end |
                    select((by > 0 and . < upto) or (by < 0 and . > upto));
                range(0; 10; 3)'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['0,3,6,9']
          - program: 'def while(cond; update):
                    def _while:
                        if cond then ., (update | _while) else empty end;
                    _while;
                [while(.<100; .*2)]'
            input: '1'
            output: ['[1,2,4,8,16,32,64]']

  - title: Assignment
    body: |

      Assignment works a little differently in jq than in most
      programming languages. jq doesn't distinguish between references
      to and copies of something - two objects or arrays are either
      equal or not equal, without any further notion of being "the
      same object" or "not the same object".

      If an object has two fields which are arrays, `.foo` and `.bar`,
      and you append something to `.foo`, then `.bar` will not get
      bigger. Even if you've just set `.bar = .foo`. If you're used to
      programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript,
      etc. then you can think of it as though jq does a full deep copy
      of every object before it does the assignment (for performance,
      it doesn't actually do that, but that's the general idea).

    entries:
      - title: "`=`"
        body: |

          The filter `.foo = 1` will take as input an object
          and produce as output an object with the "foo" field set to
          1. There is no notion of "modifying" or "changing" something
          in jq - all jq values are immutable. For instance,

           .foo = .bar | .foo.baz = 1

          will not have the side-effect of setting .bar.baz to be set
          to 1, as the similar-looking program in Javascript, Python,
          Ruby or other languages would. Unlike these languages (but
          like Haskell and some other functional languages), there is
          no notion of two arrays or objects being "the same array" or
          "the same object". They can be equal, or not equal, but if
          we change one of them in no circumstances will the other
          change behind our backs.

          This means that it's impossible to build circular values in
          jq (such as an array whose first element is itself). This is
          quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jq program
          can produce can be represented in JSON.

          Note that the left-hand side of '=' refers to a value in `.`.
          Thus `$var.foo = 1` won't work as expected; use `$var | .foo =
          1` instead.

      - title: "`|=`"
        body: |
          As well as the assignment operator '=', jq provides the "update"
          operator '|=', which takes a filter on the right-hand side and
          works out the new value for the property of `.` being assigned
          to by running the old value through this expression. For
          instance, .foo |= .+1 will build an object with the "foo"
          field set to the input's "foo" plus 1.

          This example should show the difference between '=' and '|=':

          Provide input '{"a": {"b": 10}, "b": 20}' to the programs:

          .a = .b
          .a |= .b

          The former will set the "a" field of the input to the "b" field of the
          input, and produce the output {"a": 20}. The latter will set the "a"
          field of the input to the "a" field's "b" field, producing {"a": 10}.

          The left-hand side can be any general path expression; see `path()`.

          Note that the left-hand side of '|=' refers to a value in `.`.
          Thus `$var.foo |= . + 1` won't work as expected; use `$var |
          .foo |= . + 1` instead.

        examples:

          - program: '(..|select(type=="boolean")) |= if . then 1 else 0 end'
            input: '[true,false,[5,true,[true,[false]],false]]'
            output: ['[1,0,[5,1,[1,[0]],0]]']

      - title: "`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`"
        body: |

          jq has a few operators of the form `a op= b`, which are all
          equivalent to `a |= . op b`. So, `+= 1` can be used to increment values.

        examples:
          - program: .foo += 1
            input: '{"foo": 42}'
            output: ['{"foo": 43}']

      - title: Complex assignments
        body: |
          Lots more things are allowed on the left-hand side of a jq assignment
          than in most languages. We've already seen simple field accesses on
          the left hand side, and it's no surprise that array accesses work just
          as well:

              .posts[0].title = "JQ Manual"

          What may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may
          produce multiple results, referring to different points in the input
          document:

              .posts[].comments |= . + ["this is great"]

          That example appends the string "this is great" to the "comments"
          array of each post in the input (where the input is an object with a
          field "posts" which is an array of posts).

          When jq encounters an assignment like 'a = b', it records the "path"
          taken to select a part of the input document while executing a. This
          path is then used to find which part of the input to change while
          executing the assignment. Any filter may be used on the
          left-hand side of an equals - whichever paths it selects from the
          input will be where the assignment is performed.

          This is a very powerful operation. Suppose we wanted to add a comment
          to blog posts, using the same "blog" input above. This time, we only
          want to comment on the posts written by "stedolan". We can find those
          posts using the "select" function described earlier:

              .posts[] | select(.author == "stedolan")

          The paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that
          "stedolan" wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same way
          that we did before:

              (.posts[] | select(.author == "stedolan") | .comments) |=
                  . + ["terrible."]

  - title: Modules
    body: |

      jq has a library/module system.  Modules are files whose names end
      in `.jq`.  Modules should start with a `module` directive.
      Programs and modules must `import` their dependencies, if any.

      A search path is used to search for modules.  Each directory in
      the search path is tested twice: once with a directory named "any"
      added on the end, and once with the jq version number as a
      directory added on the end.

      For paths starting with "~/", the user's home directory is
      substituted for "~".

      For paths starting with "$ORIGIN/", the path of the directory of
      the dependent is used.  For main programs that's the path of the
      jq executable's containing directory.

      Modules may be organized into a hierarchy, with name components
      separated by double-colons ("::").  For example: "foo::bar".  Each
      component in the name corresponds to a directory on the
      filesystem.  Consecutive components with the same name are not
      allowed to avoid ambiguities (e.g., "foo::foo").

      For example, a module named "foo::bar" would be searched for in
      "foo/bar.jq" and "foo/bar/bar.jq" in the given search path. This
      is intended to allow modules to be placed in a directory along
      with, for example, version control files, README files, and so on,
      but also to allow for single-file modules.

      The search path used is as follows:

      - the directory indicated in the search key of the `import`
        directive metadata (see below)
      - otherwise any directory(ies) listed in the `-L` command-line
        argument
      - otherwise any directory(ies) listed in the `$JQ_LIBRARY_PATH`
        environment variable

      For example, with `-L$HOME/.jq` A module `foo` can be found in
      `$HOME/.jq/any/foo.jq`, `$HOME/.jq/1.4/foo.jq`,
      `$HOME/.jq/any/foo/foo.jq`, and in `$HOME/.jq/foo/foo.jq`.

    entries:
      - title: "`module NAME {<metadata>};`"
        body: |

          Defines a module named `NAME` with the given metadata.  If
          given it must be the first thing in the module.  Programs also
          may use this directive.

          The metadata must be a constant jq expression.  It should be
          an object with keys like "version", "repo", "URI", and so on.
          At this time jq doesn't use this metadata, but it is made
          available to users via the `modulemeta` builtin.

      - title: "`import NAME {<metadata>};` `import NAME {<metadata>} as NAME;`"
        body: |

          Imports a module named `NAME`.  If the second form is used
          then the module's symbols are prefixed with "NAME::".

          The metadata must be a constant jq expression.  It should be
          an object with keys like "version", "repo", "URI", and so on.
          
          The "search" key in the metadata, if present, should have a
          string value consisting of a single directory path to search.

      - title: "`modulemeta`"
        body: |

          Takes a module name as input and outputs the module's
          metadata, with the module's imports (including metadata) as
          the "deps" key.

          Programs can use this to query a module's metadata, which they
          could then use to, for example, search for, download, and
          install missing dependencies.
